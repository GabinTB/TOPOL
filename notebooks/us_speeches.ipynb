The first third is true to the form of A Sailor of Austria. An edifying slice of history told in a delightful fashion. Every page includes something fascinating about the Austro Hungarian empire as well as something laugh out loud funny. The other two thirds don't achieve the same level though. A long series of tribulations and predicaments become rather tedious. By the end of the book I had rather forgotten how enjoyable the first third of it was.",

So far, it seems to be doing quite well. I was a bit leary of the way the pump fits into the faountain (from the bottom, through a hole in the body of the bowl), but the O-ring seems to be doing its job and I've not detected any leaks yet. (That said, I'd have been more comfortable with a design where the pump inserted from the top, into a 100% sealed bowl-unit, as with the FreshFlow.)The filters for these units have not been bastardised (yet) as those for the FreshFlows have been; when it comes to my beloved pet I will not tolerate any cost-cutting tomfoolery with the design. The huge reservoir is a plus, as is the deep bowl. Be assured, if the thing starts to leak in future I will update this review accordingly; for now, 4 Stars.",

I dont really know what to label them, yet they seem to combine death and hardcore music (grindcore perhaps?) and put an interesting twist on things. Please dont listen to the reviewer that said that might sound somewhat like Hatebreed. Hatebreed is not a bad band, yet they are strictly modern hardcore, and Red Cord puts themself in another catorgory by sticking to a mostly \"Death/Grind\" Format. But to move on with the review, this is a really good album. It is a bit much to absorb at first as the combination of styles kinda plays with you, yet it seems to grow on you the more you listen. The Red Cord is a treat to extreme music, and hopefully they will continue to give us some great albums in the future. ENJOY",

I bought two sets at different times and neither set had any chips so the packaging for shipping was appropriate.3. They do seem to make things more moist when you soak them prior to using. I'm not sure you want this for ALL breads, but for pumpkin/banana that sort of thing it's awesome. I think you could not soak if you don't want the moisture.4. I haven't used them really often as I only bake for other people, not myself, but these are what I use now for any kind of recipe that I need a loaf pan for.5. I think they would be really cute to serve bread in at family parties.Quick review of instructions in case you've lost yours:Soak for 15 minutes in water prior to using. Start pans off in a COLD oven to gradually bring them to temp.**The first time I used these I forgot to do this and they didn't shatter, but it's probably not a good idea to take chances.",

You have to get a knife, and in the nut and saddle, thicken the wedges wear the strings go in, and make them deeper.Second, the standard tuning for a guitar is eadgbe. eadgbe on this size instrument will have to much slack with the strings because of the scale size. So there are to instruments that come similar to this. A guitalele made by yamaha(not sold in the U.S) and a requinto which is a mexican instrument that is also tuned to adgcea.

After his last success at adapting Dickens' A Christmas Carol, he has once again succeeded, albeit in a different way, at story adaptation. Only this time, he makes a fine Muppet movie based on Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island.The film stars Tim Curry as the Long John Silvers, although many other humans had strong parts as well, including Kevin Bishop as Jim Hawkins (the boy), and Billy Connolly (proprietor of map.) All the fun is here though, and basically the whole storyline of the novel, as the Muppets sing and dance their way through the film.This film is very entertaining for the whole family. A few dark parts might mar it for really young children, but I find that most kids would enjoy it, as I did when I was younger.",

         "The definitive text! This book is the definitive text on the connection between the United States and Japan. Readable not just for the historian, but the layman as well, the writing is superb. Snippets of information in side boxes offer amusing and informative anecdotes. One major strength of this work is that fact that the reader comes away with an idea of the Japanese perspective on the West, specifically the United States. Often either demonized or put on a pedestal by Westerners, this book provides insight into both the strengths and weaknesses of Japan as well as the West. The only drawback is that this book ends in the early 1990s, before the onset of deep recession in Japan. It would be of great value to get Dr. Boyle's perspective on the decade of the 90s and how the Japanese recession has affected Japan-US relations, as well as Japanese attitudes towards Japan itself.",

I agree with another reviewer that the ending was somehow less than what I expected, however, it also was one of those endings that leads the viewer to come to their own conclusion. You have nine people in a room and the truth is that they know each other, but they don't know how they know each other. On the surface, this is a suspenseful movie; underneath that, its a lesson about how the choices we make in life, affect the lives of others. Great movie!",

Most of this frustration is caused by the manual being horrible at descirbing the required motions with the wiimote.However, once you figure out the controls, the game becomes quite fun. If anything, all you need is good coordination and a good memory to have fun (there are ALOT of different wiimote actions).After you get over the controls (it took me a day or two), you can concentrate on enjoying the game. Slow-motion leaps and dives, 30 foot superman-esque jumps off the wall to steal homers, etc. I've read complaints about the swing being delayed a bit compared to wii sports baseball. My answer? Deal with it! Anyone half good at video games will get used to it almost immediately.
