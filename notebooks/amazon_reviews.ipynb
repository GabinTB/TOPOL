The first third is true to the form of A Sailor of Austria. An edifying slice of history told in a delightful fashion. Every page includes something fascinating about the Austro Hungarian empire as well as something laugh out loud funny. The other two thirds don't achieve the same level though.

So far, it seems to be doing quite well. I was a bit leary of the way the pump fits into the faountain (from the bottom, through a hole in the body of the bowl), but the O-ring seems to be doing its job and I've not detected any leaks yet. (That said, I'd have been more comfortable with a design where the pump inserted from the top, into a 100% sealed bowl-unit, as with the FreshFlow.)The filters for these units have not been bastardised (yet) as those for the FreshFlows have been; when it comes to my beloved pet I will not tolerate any cost-cutting tomfoolery with the design. The huge reservoir is a plus, as is the deep bowl. Be assured, if the thing starts to leak in future I will update this review accordingly; for now, 4 Stars.",

I dont really know what to label them, yet they seem to combine death and hardcore music (grindcore perhaps?) and put an interesting twist on things. Please dont listen to the reviewer that said that might sound somewhat like Hatebreed. Hatebreed is not a bad band, yet they are strictly modern hardcore, and Red Cord puts themself in another catorgory by sticking to a mostly \"Death/Grind\" Format. But to move on with the review, this is a really good album. It is a bit much to absorb at first as the combination of styles kinda plays with you, yet it seems to grow on you the more you listen. The Red Cord is a treat to extreme music, and hopefully they will continue to give us some great albums in the future. ENJOY",

I bought two sets at different times and neither set had any chips so the packaging for shipping was appropriate.3. They do seem to make things more moist when you soak them prior to using. I'm not sure you want this for ALL breads, but for pumpkin/banana that sort of thing it's awesome. I think you could not soak if you don't want the moisture.4. I haven't used them really often as I only bake for other people, not myself, but these are what I use now for any kind of recipe that I need a loaf pan for.5. I think they would be really cute to serve bread in at family parties.Quick review of instructions in case you've lost yours:Soak for 15 minutes in water prior to using. Start pans off in a COLD oven to gradually bring them to temp.**The first time I used these I forgot to do this and they didn't shatter, but it's probably not a good idea to take chances.",

You have to get a knife, and in the nut and saddle, thicken the wedges wear the strings go in, and make them deeper.Second, the standard tuning for a guitar is eadgbe. eadgbe on this size instrument will have to much slack with the strings because of the scale size. So there are to instruments that come similar to this. A guitalele made by yamaha(not sold in the U.S) and a requinto which is a mexican instrument that is also tuned to adgcea.

         "The definitive text! This book is the definitive text on the connection between the United States and Japan. Readable not just for the historian, but the layman as well, the writing is superb. Snippets of information in side boxes offer amusing and informative anecdotes. One major strength of this work is that fact that the reader comes away with an idea of the Japanese perspective on the West, specifically the United States. Often either demonized or put on a pedestal by Westerners, this book provides insight into both the strengths and weaknesses of Japan as well as the West. The only drawback is that this book ends in the early 1990s, before the onset of deep recession in Japan. It would be of great value to get Dr. Boyle's perspective on the decade of the 90s and how the Japanese recession has affected Japan-US relations, as well as Japanese attitudes towards Japan itself.",

Well, if I'm paying for a show it's because in my book it's 5 stars, and next to parking lot wars, and hard core pawn, Pauly D is a show that I enjoy. We all got o know Pauly on Jersey Shore, and I for one and glad to see Pauly D continue on.I like the chemistry between Pauly and his \"bro's\". I'll acknowledge that after a few seasons the shows concept may be hard to keep fresh, but for now I'm just enjoying watching my (T.V.) friend Pauly D. have the success that a positive attitude should bring to anyone's life.Rock on Pauly D, (and \"bro's\")",

I agree with another reviewer that the ending was somehow less than what I expected, however, it also was one of those endings that leads the viewer to come to their own conclusion. You have nine people in a room and the truth is that they know each other, but they don't know how they know each other. On the surface, this is a suspenseful movie; underneath that, its a lesson about how the choices we make in life, affect the lives of others. Great movie!",

Most of this frustration is caused by the manual being horrible at descirbing the required motions with the wiimote.However, once you figure out the controls, the game becomes quite fun. If anything, all you need is good coordination and a good memory to have fun (there are ALOT of different wiimote actions).After you get over the controls (it took me a day or two), you can concentrate on enjoying the game. Slow-motion leaps and dives, 30 foot superman-esque jumps off the wall to steal homers, etc. I've read complaints about the swing being delayed a bit compared to wii sports baseball. My answer? Deal with it! Anyone half good at video games will get used to it almost immediately.

         "['One of the best albums of DATE Set aside copyright or CD issues. This is not the artists choice, this is a bigger problem with the whole record industry, and has nothing to do with a \"review\" about the music. I get the feeling some people have not actually taken the time and listened to this entire album before deciding to write some type of disgruntled review, which is ridiculous. This is one of those rare albums that each and every single song on there is absolutely amazing. The kind of CD you put in car and enjoy the ride, because each song makes you move and sing along. The kind of album you put in when friends are over and while they are moving to the beat they ask who it is because its like nothing they\\'ve heard before, but love it. I love music of all genres, from rock to hip hop to country, and this just hits on every mark. This is a brilliant album, and a brilliant artist.', 'Like finding buried treasure... Like any treasure, must be heard to be appreciated. Stop reading this review right now and buy it and listen to it as I am: songs you know by heart and thought you knew and that you hear again as if the first time, at once familiar and foreign. Best part: Bob forgetting the opening to \"I Don\\'t Believe You\" and having the audience feed him the line.Just amazing stuff from someone who continues to amaze, even DATE.So enough! I\\'ll leave the philosophizing and preaching to others. I\\'m going back to listen to the CD; I can\\'t get enough of it!', 'Unexpected triumph. I grabbed this album when it was released in DATE and have never grown tired of it. I recently bought the CD, since my cassette tape has long since worn thin. I was drawn to the album by \"Gentlemen Who Fell,\" which received enough airplay to capture my attentinon. I was pleasantly surprised, though, with the rest of the work. \"In a Glade\" became one of my favorites. Since her music is unique, I can only describe the work as a thoughtful, sometimes dark, but lyrically sound and musically engaging piece of art. As one of my favorite albums, I can\\'t say anything negative about this album. Not a mainstream work to appeal to the masses, it is an excellent collection. No regrets, only pleasant surprises. Definitely worth a listen.', 'A really good cd i\\'m going to have to go with the other reviews and say that this is an awesome cd, but but should not be your first They cd. The songs take some getting used to, but there are some real treasures - \"Hey, Mr. DJ\", \"Don\\'t Let\\'s Start\", and the wonderful Untitled Track NUM - for those of you who are not familiar with this, it is an actual recording from when you could leave a message at Dial-A-Song (NUM-NUM-NUM just a call to local brooklyn!), and a woman named Gloria didn\\'t realize her conference call was being recorded....anyway, if you like They, then get this cd. If not, get another one or two (i\\'d recommend Flood for a first one, or maybe Apollo NUM), then buy it!', 'Stellar! Five stars is just enough to describe this CD. If the word \"stellar\" is not enough, I would add \"uncompromising.\" Every track on the CD is a high-quality new experience you will be eager to repeat. You might find yourself completely addicted! I have not stopped listening to this one for DATE, and my changer usually has high turnaround.If it were necessary to pigeonhole the disc, the most likely fit is \"alternative power ballad,\" but expect more creative range and catchiness than that label would allow. What a strong voice my man Waymon has! When the group did a live spot for Atlanta\\'s radio station 99X, he had to stand back from the mic to prevent feedback. This is not overproduced alternative; it is genuine rock quality.', 'A Great CD!! I just brouth the cd DATE and i have played it non-stop since i got it. I heard of NFG before i got the cd but i never really heard anything from them. I had burned a cd with one of the songs from this album for one of my friends and i really liked the song so i decided to get the cd if i ever found it. Sowhen i found it i was thinking if i should get this CD or another one that was in my hand. I decided this CD and im damn sure happy i did. I think all the songs are great nd id say Hit or Miss and Boy Crazy are my favorite songs on the CD. Since i got it though i have not stoped playing it and i enjoy playing it cause when i am under the weather this is a godd CD to listen to to bring me back up so i say anyone should get this cd no matter hwat you listen to cause i myself love hardrock more than anything but this would have to be on top of my list of cds.', \"Simply Magnifficent What can I say?I wish I could give this ten stars.(...)Edie Brickell is my favourite female vocalist of all and I absolutely adore the youthful and sensual beauty of her angelic voiceNot only this the lyrics are very good .Edie ,who writes the lyrics, has a great turn of phrase , 'philosophy is a walk on the slippery rocksreligion is alight in the fog'and 'There's nothing I hate more than nothingNothing keeps me up at nightI toss and turn over nothingNothing can cause a great big fight'And DATE album is by far the best of Edie Brickell and The New BohemiansApart from 'the well known and wonderful 'What I Am' and 'Circle ' there are also other beautiful melodies like 'Little Miss S' , 'Air of DATE' ,'The Wheel' ,Love Like We Do' ,'Circle' ,Beat the Tune' and 'Nothing' I could listen for TIME and still want more.if you like good music I cannot recommend this one enough\", \"Why you have to love this record! Many of us G.L.J. fans wondered whatever became of Gene Loves J, after the fantastic early records Promise and Immigrant, they seemed to drift into a so-so sea of pop mediocrity, What became of the passion and originality of DATE, it's so apparent now! Love Lies Bleeding was clear a signal enough to what was missing all these years and Giving Up The Ghost is dna evidence of the genius lost. This is a remarkable document. So diverse and original and just magnificent. There are so many avenues explored, it's Pollack and Picasso too and poetic and street wise, it rOCKS!!! DATE the world will discover this Artist and I pray sooner than later because Michael deserves recognition above all who walk this landscape. Touching, passionate, tender and witty.

I now own three versions of it and the Collector's DVD is by far the best - the transfer is great and the soundtrack (well done in its own right - I own that too) is far better presented than on the old DVD edition. I cannot stress how much I like this movie - buy it now.\", \"Terrific Family Movie This is a great family movie. My wife and I first saw it on a Netflix rental, and bought it on Amazon to have for visiting family and friends. It is has drama, comedy, incredible music and choral singing, great acting and cinematography, enough realism to avoid being a saccharine fairy tale, and a minor surprise ending to remind us that amid all the tragedy, ruthlessness, and sorrow in life, we can still hope that good will win out!

I watched the video with my DATE niece and she enjoyed it. The acting and directing was wonderful. The film has a \"low budget\" feeling like the lives it\\'s charaters lived. The dialog was quick, witty, and real. The actor who played Phil was great. He was able to hold his own with Gena Rowlands and that says a lot!!!

The movies strongest attributes are its exceptional cast and moving story. Everyone is perfectly cast and there isn't an actor I would change. The brightest of all these bright stars are Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Toro (who won best supporting actor), and Don Cheadle. The story is told like Nashville and Magnolia. There are several mini stories that intertwine. I also loved the different colored lenses for each story. The DVD has superb picture and sound quality. If you're one of those people that likes a truck load of extras though, I suggest you wait for a special edition to be released.

It is nice to have good quality sound that allows you to hear what is going on around you, or turn them up to hear crisp bass and clear highs. Having a convenient pair of headphones where you need them is better than than having a more expensive headphone worrying about them being stolen or broken during transport/storage.I may not have needed to buy so many, all are still working well with good sound quality and cords and ear foam that is still comfortable to wear.\", \"Great system... after NUM returns.

This book reminds me of the ones my mother\\'s book club read in the DATE\\'s before \"Forever Amber\" came on the market and caused such a \"splash\".This was back when Faith Baldwin wrote such good stories, ones that held your attention and about good people who \"just did the best they could\" and did it with grace. I am looking forward to this writer\\'s \"follow up\" story.', \"This book rekindled my love for reading!!! I picked this book up while I was out of town. You first need to understand that I haven't read anything for fun in DATE! I picked it up at a chain store for $NUM; not really sure I would even be able to get through the first chapter without dozing off. But nevertheless, I checked out with my book and headed back. When I settled down with this book and a hot cup of coffee on the deck TIME, I never dreamt that I would find myself finishing it (Yes! I read it cover to cover) at NUM:15am the following morning!!!Since then I have been on a tear of reading, got myself a library card and haven't looked back :) Enjoy this book as much as I did, I promise that it'll be worth it!\", 'Pleasant Read!

I recently picked up a copy of this book in the independently published section of a bookstore and after reading it, I can't understand why some big publisher hasn't jumped on this! IT WAS GREAT!!! The story moved quickly and kept my interest throughout, which is not an easy task. I loved the main characters and well as the secondary ones as well. Not only was I thoroughly entertained, but I even walked away learning a thing or two about forgiveness. I definitely think this is an author we'll be hearing much about. Bring on the next book!!!!\", \"Unexpected Elegant in it's simplicity, profound in it's depth.I'm always cautious about books that friends say are 'must reads' for certain situations. We all have a desire for quick and easy answers and I find those to be more often shallow and distracting than actually helpful in addressing fundamental issues. So I was very reluctant to read this the first time it was suggested to me DATE, but I did because I trusted the man who gave it to me, and I was desperately in need of hope...It's an easy read, but very hard to forget. It's still with me two-and-a-half decades later, and so is my family which was very much at risk during my 'hell' that led me to a place of listening. No short answers here, but easy to grasp concepts that can change lives in the contexts of deep pain and our relationship to a God that never stops loving us.\", \"Amazing how close to reality this novel is This one seemed as though it was ripped from DATE's headlines. I read The Lion's Game almost DATE, and thoroughly enjoyed it back then. It's one of those novels that is just written so well that you can't wait to get to the next chapter.What makes this novel work so well is the main character, who also narrates. John Corey tells the story with just enough wit to keep it entertaining. It is the wit that drives this story, even though there is more than enough action.If you liked Plum Island, and liked John Corey in that novel, then this is a must read. If you like action/suspense novels, you'd be doing yourself a big favor by picking this up.\", 'the best little-bit-of-everything book around Are you in a suspense, thriller, and mystery reading phase?Enjoy paranormal phenonemna?

At the heart of the story is a mostunusual romance.

It is sad that it takes a person to lose his or her own life for us to get together. Here you have this lady who is killed. No one knows why, and the ladies she used to hang out with back in DATE get together to find out why. From TIME I opened this book, I have been truly entertained by this novel to give it the five stars it deserves. I am so glad to see more and more African American authors in the spotlight, and I hope to see more of them as time goes on. One more thing. in this book, Elmo truly got ran over and Justice was truly served. Ursula needs a well deserved butt whipping, and kudos to the Justus Girls for coming to the aid of Peaches'kids.

         "['Sad to see all of these one-star ratings I think that the majority of these negative reviews come from readers who can\\'t appreciate a novel from a truly artistic point of view. The characters (especially Billy, who had a very limited voice) were very well developed, and the plot was well thought out. Many negative reviews focused on the \"lack of action.\" Does a novel need to be action packed to be good? If you think so, then stick to your MTV culture. CB is full of wonderful detail and exquisite storytelling. This novel deals with many issues that affect nearly all of us and should be read carefully. As far as those who criticize having to re-read passages, do you really want a book that doesn\\'t make you stop to think once in a while? Definately worthwhile, and deserving of a second reading by those who felt it \\'boring.\\'', \"I Liked This Intro to an Amazing Life It is sad that the errors that were noted by the other reviewers have marred the book. I did not know they were there and so what I got from this book was this fantastically gifted man and the passions of his life. This compact life is really full of drama. The monologues, debated in other comments, are based on the things Kelly expressed in other ways, as I understand it, but they weren't necessary. I was not bothered by the concise description of DATE of fizzles and disappointments in Kelly's later life. I can recommend this book as a very enjoyable read, and quite good for young readers, but it seems clear a big, fat, long, unimpeachably correct bio would make a lot of other people happy.\", 'slow start, good finish I bought the book based on the good reviews. After about a fourth of the book I was quite bored with it and went online to see if it was worth continuing. It seemed so. After the long, long part about the depression ends, the book becomes a real page-turner with some great insights into English and America culture. Very hard to put down and a very satisfying read!', \"Two Books in One I really enjoyed most of book... but it had an awkward pace.. Parts of it like the visit to Libby Hatches mothers house had me on edge. Other parts, like over descriptive dinner scenes were annoying. The end was disappointing. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it.. but a space ship could have landed to save DATE out of nowhere and had the same effect. I wish the ending had stayed with the story. The characters were great and saved the book, especially El Nino.\", 'Very readable Essentially there is nothing wrong with this book - in fact it is very compelling and readable and as such deserves a NUM star rating.Still in saying that I wonder what made Colleen write about such a religious event but duplicated in the future? It is not offensive in my mind but others who take the Christian religion seriously may see this book as blasphemy.Others like me who are not so worried will find this an easy and entertaining read that will leave you feeling a trifle sad about the world she has created in this novel.', \"Thoughtful book Like another reviewer, I agree that this is NOT the definitive treatise on the problems of the working poor but it takes a slice of the situation and analyzes it very well.We live well at the expense of others.That is a sobering thought. Moreover (though Ehrenreich doesn't go there at all) we do it not only at the expense of our fellow Americans but also global family members as well.On DATE when I had more time, it would be entertaining to read all of the one-star reviewers. Those reviewers will tell you more about themselves than the book. (I want to simultaneously apologize for that grossly biased remark, but many of those folks were unwilling to minutely face the costs attached to their life style and who pays).A thoughtful but quick read.\", 'Too Much Talk for My Tastes There\\'s lot of amusing insights into relationships here, combined with visuals by a very gifted artist.Unfortunately, the relationships ring hollow to me -- I just don\\'t believe in Anne, Ricky, and what\\'s-her-name as real people. They seem designed mainly for humour.The early part of the book is non-stop talking heads with little or no plot or action. The early chapters could be interchanged without much problem. The visuals liven up the succession of heads, but I found the artwork a little too lively; with shots from every angle, and expressions jumping from joy to angst in rapid succession.The latter half of the book livens up with Anne\\'s trip to LA and San Francisco. There was some action, and events that I could believe in.The road-trip elements at the end of the book might suggest \"Thelma and Louise\", but I believe this book was first published before the movie (?).', \"A good book that will rankle the close-minded This book is not perfect. For example, it seemes to me that Wills misunderstands Thoreau's use of irony, and I'm not sure the causal link between Reagan and abortion clinic bombings is as strong as Wills suggests. But most of the customers who have reviewed this book either NUM) haven't really read all the book or NUM) are hopelessly close minded.That said, I'll just add that Wills's latest book is a masterful analysis of the very fiber of American society. I don't know anyone who LOVES the government, but Wills shows why it is essential to our well-being, how it is a vital force in making this great country what it is. Few people know more about the Constitution than Wills, but he is not (as some readers suggest) a mere liberal pedant. Sometimes the truth hurts.\", 'A good read- but not if you\\'re looking for action. I\\'ll admit it. I HATED Hemingway after the mandatory \"Old Man and the Sea\" in high school, but when I saw this book, I had to give it a try, even if Hemingway was the author and I wasn\\'t dissapointed. It isn\\'t a plot filled with action or intrigue, but it is complex and fascinating in how it describes the personal relaitonships of the impotent protagonist Jake, his less than innocent love Brett, and the annoying tag-along Robert Cohn along with a slew of others that reminds me so much of the high school \"in crowd\" I started casting the characters with people I knew. It isn\\'t a book for everybody, in fact, unless you like working to understand meaning in a book this isn\\'t the one for you. However if you\\'re looking for more than a casual read you won\\'t be dissapointed. This is one of his very best.', 'Not bad, but wish for more... Some of the earlier chapter\\'s were well written and very intriguing, such as \"What if Jesus Had Lived?\" and \"China\\'s exploration carried further\". However some of it wasn\\'t all to interesting such as \"What if Hitler had lived?\", to sum it up as the book says, it wouldn\\'t matter, bleah! It is still worth it if you liked the first book that they did. However if you\\'re not much of an alternative history nut to begin with, don\\'t bother.']",

In DATE and age of bells and whistles, it is refreshingly simple.The only thing we don't like about it is that it falls down very easily.

This game is a little hard to master and the default settings are a little too high, but it can be adjusted. Tons of extras, hidden characters, great effects, great music... and a very low price! I usually dislike the Capcom games, but I really love this one. DATE I received Crazy Taxi NUM, but after TIME I went back to Project Justice (don't get me wrong CT2 is Awesome too!). A must have for a true 3D fighter lover.\", \"Great!!!! This game is the best game I have ever had! Don't worry about the Teen rating. Its very fun. The only problem is, you can't pick what dog you can be. When the game starts, you just end up controling that Jake dog. The other thing that I'm annoyed at, is that my DATE sister wants to play badly. Why can't this game be for NUM players so that I can verse my sister at mini games?! Howerver, the game is still is very fun.\", \"Warning Warning:some people complain you don't playh much at the beginning, well thats somewhat true, but if you do not watch what happens, then the game will be so much worse. Also, be sure to buy this when you don't have anything to do in DATE, because beware: this game is the most addicting game out on the market, i played this for DATE for TIME a day, and i still play it now, DATE after i bought it, please buy this game if you want to play the very best of ps2 games, this sold way more than GTA3 and MGS2, as hard as it seems it is true, it sold like NUM million copies in japan in DATE! buy this game, any videogame website will rate this at least a NUM, its that good. do yourself a favor and go get it now!\", 'Extraordinary game This game is probably the best I\\'ve ever played, and perhaps the best game I will ever play. It has all of the features you could want in a turn based game.The automation of funtions is incredible. Based on your wishes, you can designate tasks for units to perform, instead of dealing with the monotony of reissuing the same command turn after turn. For example, you can just say tell a unit to \"build road\", and it will only build roads... and will do so in places that make sense. Truly amazing AI...Add to that the rich cultures and philosophies of the characters, ability to customize units any way you\\'d like, great sci-fi, and you\\'re left with a game that is still a force to be contented with DATE after its release.However, because of the wide range of possibilities, the game can be quite complex.If you\\'re not intimidated by having to think, this game is definitely for you. I look forward to a sequel, should they ever develop one.', 'this game is for and one who used there brain more than once this could be so much fun for you if your realy cant get a date but its just a game so do get to happy lol so if you like rpg and like the long crud games that some people dont get go for it i cant say much but its great and the pics are cool but it realy for DATE older if u ask me', \"if you want to be happy, BUY THIS GAME! This game never gets old and is actually one of the few games that I had a hard time with. It took me over DATE to beat it. It's the best game of all, and still is\", 'This game is fun I personaly liked this game. some levels were hard but eventially you will pass them. the cool part is that you can be on the darkside on some bonus levels. the graphics are good and you can use cooler ships than the nintendo NUM game. if you really want some cooler ships like the slave NUM put in a code. you will like this game if you buy it.', 'wow I have to admit this is a great game.although people say the game has poorly drawn images(i toldy disagree on)it is an exciting and fun game.It relies on stategy and your knowledge over the units.You get to use land,sea,and air units.I would sugest that people buy this game.', \"pretty good game I borrowed Buck Bumble from a friend awhile back and I thought it was a pretty good game. The only things I didn't like about it were that after you get past mission NUM, it gets too hard and every time you get killed, you have to start all the way over in that level. It's fun flying and killing the enemies and the boss levels are a lot of fun, but Buck has to be the slowest walker ever made when you try combat from the ground. The insects and graphics are done pretty well, but they could be a little bit better. The sound is probably the best attribute to the game other than the fun factor.To keep it from getting too boring, there's a NUM player soccer game that makes this game a lot better. If you want a challenging shooting/adventure game, this could be a good game to get.\"]",

You will sweat you butt off, I couldn't do all the routines but by my 4th workout I was improving. In DATE; NUM sessions I lost NUM IBS. I could not believe it. No DVD workout has did that before and trust me I have all of them. You actually have fun with this DVD, by the time you realize it you have done TIME. There isn't alot of teaching here so just follow along. I reminded me of the latin parties growing up in NYC.

The music isn't as cheezy as most of them, and I think it's quite inspirational now. This workout starts out slowly, and then it picks up. What I like about it is if I don't feel up to it, I can keep my feet on the floor (not jump if I don't want to) and still feel like I had a good workout. I usually only do the aerobic portion which is only NUM mins, but there's also a toning portion targeting all those fun areas.

Your heartrate will be up, but I was never gasping for breath (which is good!) Chris definitely has a cheerful personality that isn't overwhelming. She's encoraging, motivating, and makes you hit all the areas of your body. If your looking something that really intense, this video isn't it, but I still feel it's a decent workout.

At the highest resolution, file sizes have been between NUM and NUM meg. The digital zoom is great - I used it at my son's baseball game and was able to zoom in on an outfielder and get some great shots. Redeye only works in portrait mode - not auto mode (unless I just haven't found the right setting). Flash doesn't automatically pop up when you need it but it will display an icon when you need it.

Full manual control is also nice. How good is the picture quality? I found that when mounted on a tripod, the A510 would take sharper pictures than a EOS Digital Rebel using a $NUM wide-angle lens. Compacts have matched lens/sensor pairs and this is a good example.The only negative features- Limited 640x480 video time to TIME, pretty chunky overall.This little Canon has outlasted two other point and shoots, a Kodak V705, and a Coolpix S570.Recommended, even at DATE.\", 'Does everything I need and more!

I have listened to this off and on for DATE, waiting for most of the songs to catch on, and what I have found is that most of the cuts are to \\'noise orientated\\' and sloppy. Songs that are plain awful are \\'Bomb\\', \\'Testosterone\\', \\'Monkey\\', and \\'Alien\\'. To much \"whining\" from the lead singer and not a mealody to be found from the guitarist ! I call this a dirty trick, figuring that this is the same group that came up with excellent songs such as \\'Everything Zen\\' and \\'Comedown\\'. These songs show so much craftsmanship that I would expect the same from all (or most) of the songs. It just doesn\\'t happen ! Figuring \\'Razorblade Suitcase\\' and \\'Deconstructed\\' are failures for this band - I think we will be seeing them in DATE on VH1\\'s WHERE ARE THEY NOW segments.', 'not worth the star i gave it Well boys and girls the next time you look up the word mistake you will see a picture of me holding this CD. What a waste of hard earned cash!!! this CD was such bore with what seemed to be a complete lack of imagination, not only on the part of Tenaglia but, on the part of the producers too. It seems like in todays Music industry creativity is a Bad word. SOOOooo incredibly boring... When I bought it I thought I was gonna get some smooth tunes maybe something to relax to but, NO!!! instead what I got was the worst display of.... \"I sold out and, now that my name can sell CD\\'s who cares what I sell\" .....For those who like this CD I recomend a check up at your nearest Physicians A.S.A.P you might have Mono good luck but get a difrent CD', \"Very disappointing to me I am a very, very big Elliott Smith fan and have been for DATE, the kind who has every recording, live, bootleg, videos of him playing, saw him live, read his biography, etc. I am selling my copy of this album without even ripping it because there isn't a single song on it that does anything new with the music or is in any way better than the originals. In short, they all suck. Waste of time, waste of money. But hey, maybe it's just me.....\", \"I wish there was the zero star option This album does not even deserve the praise of one mesely star. The music was just some computer recreation of Britney's songs. I thought the days of synthesizing music was over, apparently not! I can't believe people buy this garbage, they don't play instruments, I don't even know if there is a band. The lyrics are laughable (not that they even write them) and their voices are poor at best. To call these guy musicians or even artists should offend anyone with a brain. I'm sorry, but they're awful, and the fact that they used a title the Stones used makes it that much worse...Don't buy this CD, please for your mind's sake.\", \"Choose Another CD! (sigh)I hate doing a negative review of a CD by an artist I really like, but this thing sucks. The remastering is first class; the sound is really good. But some #@& decided to take Richard's LAST GOOD LP and re-sequence the songs, add songs that weren't on the vinyl album, delete ones that were on it - and worst of all - FADE OUT A SONG BEFORE IT'S FINISHED (Poor Dog).It's an insult to Little Richard, who has seen so many of his songs mistreated. If you liked your vinyl version, don't buy this. If you've heard about this legendary LP and want it on CD, don't buy this one. Like I said, it hurts, but what I say is true! I would've given it no stars if possible.And PS: if there's a line under this about voting buttons, it's an Amazon virus - I didn't write it.\", 'How annoying can it be? When I purchased this disc I thought it would be in my collection until DATE I died. I had no idea that after listening to only two songs, I would be selling it back to the store for only a fraction of what I paid. If you are thinking of buying it and have read the complaints in regards to teen backup singers, beware. It really is as bad as I am saying it is.', \"One good song... I ordered this CD based on one song I had heard. It turns out that is the ONLY good song on it. The rest of the CD isn't anything I want to listen to. What else can I say? Steer clear...\", 'Pretend this one wasn\\'t made I have not heard Kerplunk, but probably out of Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod, Warning, and American Idiot, this is the only one I would truly label as bad (Nimrod was better, but not great either). The sound is very forced. DATE admitted that they tried to make it darker sounding to lash out at fans who criticized them as sellouts. It also was trying a little too hard to preserve the \"I\\'m still punk\" notion which fortunately DATE gave up DATE.I have known for a long time that Billie Joe was never the best guitar player, (except the guitar playing is pretty good now)and Brain Stew\\'s refrain that is supposed to sound like a ticking clock is very bad. It sounded even worse in the live album, Bullet in the Bible.Geek Stink Breath is really the only other song on this album I liked. However, its too short and the guitar playing way too simple.In general, unless you are a major DATE fan, there really isn\\'t much you\\'re missing in this album.', \"load, reload, and pull the trigger fellas...its over I thought load and reload were bad. Now I'm begging for their return. There's no difference between this [stuff] and any of the nu-metal [stuff] thats been so popular lately. I popped ride the lightning into my cd player just to remember what they used to sound like. This isnt a return to anything, just another.... attempt by the band to evolve into something more mainstream. This cd has no solid intro's, no good guitar solo's, and no good lyrics. Some people are saying the drums are really good on this album, but all it sounds like to me is a DATE banging on a pot with a spoon. Even the best song on the cd, St. Anger, is worse than anything they've ever produced before. Hetfield's voice is just horrible. I can't stand what they've turned into; a bunch of money grubbin' has beens. I own every cd they've ever made but I refuse to buy this one. Maybe I'll download it - just to pay homage to the band and their recent efforts.\", \"All the songs sound the same I didn't buy this album. Although I don't think it's nessesary since it seems Everclear is planning on airing all their songs on the radio anyway. All I have to say is that I can't believe almost nobody notices that all the sons use the same chords, over and over again. The only reason I gave this CD an extra star its because some of the lyrics are good and were written with a good purpose, although expressed through a bad medium. I honestly think there's room for improvement... A LOT of room.\"]",

I actaully shut this one off due to complete bordem which is something I never do. The best thing I can suggest for this dvd is that you use it as a frisbee to wing at someone.It was inspired by the true story of a NUM foot crocodile that was responsible for over NUM deaths. This inspires a crew of flunkies to go to Africa to find the man eating beast, but instead takes a turn towards the economic problems of the people. I wish in TIME the croc would have eaten the crew and gotten the movie over with. Orlando Jones starred in this mess in which I saw better acting from him in his old sprite commercials.This one definately doesn\\'t get my seal of approval. Instead of wasting TIME on this disaster pick up a B masterpiece like \"Death Ring\" or \"Lock Up\"', \"Boring as hell I waited so long to see this film and when I got to see it on dvd it was by far the worst movie I saw DATE.The reviewers make this movie overrated its so stupid you'll even might get distracted by Roberts drug crack eyes,it was so bad my little brother and mom walk out the living room to see something else,I felt so embarrassed that happen,oh and its nothing like the cartoon and Robert is too damn short to play such a tall man its ridiculous.There is no action at all only at the end and it still sucks.There is so much talking about crap no one cares about and robert trying to make the audience laugh with his corny boring jokes and its very long too so get ready to kill yourself at the end and no I will not be seeing part NUM if I want to see a crackhead I'll just walk down my neighborhood.\", 'They call this entertainment I am sure am glad I did not rent,buy or purchase a ticket to see this movie that everybody was so amazed by with it 3D special effects and had it not been for a freebie view from HBO I would not have cared so I decided to record it for later view After TIME of this I decided I had better thing to watch and do than spend another NUM hrs plus watching a bunch junk. There was no need to have people speak in another alien voice and use sub titles that went out in the DATE and this was supposed to be a high tech hit I beg to differ. Acting such as it was was poor and plot was jumpy and hard to follow. NUM star is all it getting and no more so save your money and download here or wait and you will find it at a yard sale sooner or later.', \"Wow..Looks like a high school cinematography project This movie was amongst the worst I've ever seen in my entire life, and that includes several terrible Steven Seagal generic-CG stealth fighter movies.Seriously, do not even CONSIDER renting this movie. Save your money, time, and the disappointment. If you see ANY positive reviews on this movie it's either someone unfortunately involved in the making of this film or it's an intended joke. One look at the first CG'd monster and you'll laugh. I fast-forwarded through to see if there was any substance to the film, but it remained shallow throughout and at one point even repeated the entire opening scene in the middle of the movie. There is no cinematic quality here. Zero. Might as well have been filmed by students just discovering how to use a video camera and edit films. How did this make Redbox?!\", 'Well, that was terrible... I\\'m disapointed that I\\'m never getting back TIME of my life I wasted on watching \"The Descent.\" It\\'s just as stupid as the Project Greenlight movie, \"Feast\" (horror/sci fi). This one definitly goes on the list of movies I wish I DIDN\\'T watch.

The movie SUCKED--stupid story about one killing after the other with NUM of the same characters throughout this mess, filmed NUM% in the same room and talk ,talk and then stab.Please dont waste your money on this crap and dont believe the reviews that this was a great horror/slasher film.After seeing it, I threw it in the garbage--I would be a fool to give it to anyone who would think I was crazy for seeing this trash. STAY AWAY and save yourmoney.', \"I Can't Believe I Watched the Whole Thing Definitely the absolute WORST movie I have ever seen. I usually don't sit through a movie if it's bad, but I sat through this one, unfortunately. Completely boring, no plot, nothing interesting. TIME long. When there was TIME of it to go, I could not bear to watch it any longer, but watched it anyway in hopes that TIME I just wasted would at least be redeemed at the end. Sorry it wasn't. How can this possibly have so many good ratings I don't understand. The worst, and most boring , and the stupidest movie ever. And what did the stupid rabbit head scenes have to do with anything? For that matter what did any of the movie have to do with anything? It made absolutely NO sense. Someone must have been paid to write good reviews about this joke of a movie.\", 'Don\\'t be a stooge This is a classic example of the trailer showing the only funny part of the move. I watched the old B&W show as a kid, evidently the people involved with the final product of this movie missed the point somehow. My wife & I got as far as the \"bell\" scene before we turned it off. Too bad you can\\'t get a refund on sucky movie rentals.', 'Mindless and unoriginal I must say that after having watched this I was offended that a friend had recommended it to me. I have no problems with the movie\\'s message; my problem is with its complete lack of originality. I cannot recall an original moment in this entire movie. What I can recall is gratuitous edginess and a mindless collection of plotlines and vignettes ripped from movies like Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, and the Professional. I understand that in watching a film like this one needs to suspend a measure of disbelief, but this film asks its viewers to be idiots. The dialogue is terrible and the scenarios the characters find themselves in are often moronic. It seems like Duffy had a whole list of \"Holy , wouldn\\'t it be cool if...\" moments and strung them together and expected them to make a movie. My only real wish is to have my TIME back. Be thankful that the sequel never made it off the ground.', \"Sucks!!! One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The cinematography is good, acting is decent, which actually takes away from the movie. The plot is extremley boring and the only out you look for in terms of comedy is hoping to get some unintential comedy, but the film doesnt even grant you that. A misleading title at best, and I'm not sure what exactly was unrated about the version I saw, but this is a BAD movie. I enjoyed N Dynomite, Road Trip, and such, but this isnt even close. I'm not sure how this can even be described as a comedy.\"]",

Again, I'm not scared of tools so I fixed it again. After DATE the heavy duty drawer guide/racks or whatever started to chip the cheap-o particle board right out.

Furthermore in the pictured section on core exercises, the authors simply cluster core exercises together into broad sections without explaining which muscles the exercises are targeting. Finally, the models in this book are all old and ugly. I wish I could return this book. The authors should have had me edit their work before publication.', 'Waste of money I should have listened to the other poor reviews and saved my money.

When picking balls out of a bucket you need to take the swing band off and put it on again. Of course, this is always going to be required for all shots off a tee. I found this on-off process to be a pain because the Swing Band has to be re-set up each time. You can try handling balls with the device on, however, it's much more difficult.Before purchasing, I recommend that you try securing your hands together with some rubber bands.

I bought the discs separately but I really wish that I had purchased the box set because some of the discs' aren't worth it. It's fun to watch and it's not bad for you but not worth it if you are looking for an actual workout.\", \"So, so ANNOYING! This has got to be the most annoying workout video I have ever done! I thought Denise Autsin was bad. DATE is so annoying! She talks to her sister-in-law/trainer and thinks she is hilarious. She tries to crack jokes and thinks she is so funny. Her and her SIL's banter is just intolerable.If I do this video again, I will mute the volume and put some decent music on so I dont have to hear DATE.I am so disappointed I bought this. It gets NUM starts because it is a decent workout. It is really long and drawn out, especially the long versions...I would definitely recommend only doing the express workouts. Even with those, I found myself waiting around and sighing.I cant believe there arent more reviews of annoyed viewers!\", \"I don't get it Based on these glowing reviews, I was expecting a fantastic program. My first minor complaint is the voiceover narration. I can understand why yoga instructors choose this format, but I guess I'm partial to live instruction. Perhaps I would have found the voiceover narration more tolerable had this dvd been setup differently. A mix-n-match option sounds like a potentially great idea, but the routines on this dvd are choppy and repetitive. My biggest complaint is the constant use of props. I bought this dvd to relax and relieve stress. I did not buy this dvd to fold towels in thirds.. place pillows here and there.. etc...This is a hugely overrated title, in my opinion.\"]",

         "[\"The worst pictures I have ever seen DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. . . at least, don't buy this camera if you want to actually have decent pictures to print and keep for a lifetime and for generations to come. I actually read the manual and learned how to use all the features and still NUM% of the pictures I've taken over DATE are blurred or very pixillated. Yes, I modified the pixels to the highest resolution and am still having issues. If you want a cheap camera, and don't care about having quality pictures to preserve, then this is the camera for you. If not, save the $NUM+ dollars you would have spent, and budget for a more expensive, higher quality camera. I'm sending mine back and upgrading. One positive note is the Camedia software. I've used it with a higher quality Olympus camera (a lot more $) which was stolen from me DATE, and I really love it; which is why I'm staying with the Olympus brand, despite the poor quality of the D-Series model.\", 'Gawd Has Foresaken me... I got this camera very quickly, service was fantastic. I say this because any retailer who sells these shouldnt feel too responsible for the sin that is this camera. I have had my dealings with NUM.2mp cameras, some made in DATE and I am very appalled to have used this camera and to get this kind of low quality shot.Pictures are blurry. Well unless you use the flash, then they are completely \"pixelated\" and are engulfed in white.This is not a deal for the money, it doesnt even serve its purpose as a camera.I will say I love the design of the camera, and this just makes me want apple to delve into the camera industry.Conclusion: dont purchase this if you\\'re looking for something to take pictures with. If you want to load this on your computer and waste your time, go for it, otherwise, buy anything else.', \"Terrible Camera I purchased this camera not even DATE and recently sold it. This is the worst camera I've ever had. It constantly, no matter what setting I had on, underexposed the lighting in pictures, most of the time ruining the shot. Lighting is basically a photographer's lifeblood. And it's too big and bulky. The only good thing about this camera is how the clarity and sharpness are from such high megapixels. That's about it.Do NOT buy this camera, because you'll be sorry. I'm sorry I spent the NUM dollars I did to get this piece of junk. Unless your not a bigtime photographer, you can take just as good shots with a cheap point and shoot camera.\", \"What's the Big Deal? Yes, it's nice to have a NUM mm lens on an auto-everything camera, but other than that, I don't really understand what the big deal (the raves of other reviewers) is with this camera. The pictures are not any sharper than with my Olympus Stylus Zoom, the exposures are not that great under many conditions, it is very difficult -- if not impossible -- to stop the zoom where you want to in the middle of its range, and -- worst of all for me -- the camera comes pre-set with a printable (wrong) date, that unless you reset or erase it will ruin all of your photos!! I stupidly took this camera on vacation without testing it first and shot eleven rolls of film with it. I sure wish I had taken my Olympus instead.\", \"Not good! I don't think that this camra is very good, I took pictures and the dpi is really bad it's too big and the pictures look really bad also. I was amazed how fast the Batteries ran out. I suggest you don't buy this.\", \"BEWARE I would beware not only the camera, but of Amazon.....after having this camera for DATE, we had problems with it. We were on vacation in CA and had to buy a new camera. When we returned home we could not return the camera, Optio NUM, to Amazon because of their DATE return policy. We are now stuck with NUM ditigal camera's. Not sure what is wrong with the optio, but it does not focus for you. It is a common problem,as stores I call have had the same problems. I bought a Kodak one, and love it even better. So be becareful on your electronics from Amazon. Their return policy is stupied, and I will never buy anything from them again. Their loss. I lived on shopping with them. Oh well. I just hope I can save people from making the mistake I made......\", 'Horrible... I used this camera for a DATE untill during a period of DATE of not being turned on, something to do with the light sensor malfunctioned. I think all Canon ZR series cameras are inclined to having buggy hardware and I dont remcomend buying one.', \"Buy something else I went for a[n] [inexpensive] camera rather than one I knew anything about - my mistake. I've tried three roles of film in this camera, and in two of the roles only a couple of pictures turned out. The rest of the negatives were completely blank! The other roll (the middle one that I tried) actually had pictures on it, but they were poor quality - dark, grainy, and out of focus. I am not an expert photographer, but I certainly think I should be able to do better than this; obviously this is not a high-performance camera. ...\", \"This piece of junk died on me Usually, I have good experiences with Toshiba's products. For example, I have a Toshiba DVD player that I am very happy with. However, this digital camera was a disappointment in almost every aspect. A minor gripe was the short battery life, but that's a very common problem with digital cameras in general. Major problem #NUM: This camera has a VERY hard time focusing in low-light situations. Unless you're in a brightly lit room or outside on DATE, your pictures stand a good chance of being out of focus. Major problem #NUM: I owned this camera DATE when it refused to recognize the existence of batteries. I tried many different types of fresh batteries, but it says they're all dead. Now I have to look into getting warranty service. If I had it to do over, I would have invested a little more in a higher-quality camera (and a brand other than Toshiba). You really do get what you pay for when it comes to digital cameras.\", \"DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA! Unless of course you have plenty of shares in Duracell, Eveready and Rayovac . Bought it new, yrs ago. Right out of the box it sucked up the batteries (included) in TIME. Ok, off to buy more batts, GULP! gone in TIME! Sent it back to Kodak, they said nothing wrong with it. Bought more and better rechargeables this time, now I'm doing more research into battery life than photography!!?? With the best batts you can get, maybe NUM pics... forget trying to have the LCD screen on at same time. Reviews can't be done on batteries cuz the LCD review screen eats the batts even faster ..... plug in to wall power for that. Right now it won't power up at all unless plugged to wall socket. Takes great pics but so what if you can't take it anywhere. Now when researching for cameras the first thing I look at is battery life. Canon seems to be good for this.\"]",
