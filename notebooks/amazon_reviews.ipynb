Every page includes something fascinating about the Austro Hungarian empire as well as something laugh out loud funny. The other two thirds don't achieve the same level though.

So far, it seems to be doing quite well. I was a bit leary of the way the pump fits into the faountain (from the bottom, through a hole in the body of the bowl), but the O-ring seems to be doing its job and I've not detected any leaks yet. (That said, I'd have been more comfortable with a design where the pump inserted from the top, into a 100% sealed bowl-unit, as with the FreshFlow.)The filters for these units have not been bastardised (yet) as those for the FreshFlows have been; when it comes to my beloved pet I will not tolerate any cost-cutting tomfoolery with the design. The huge reservoir is a plus, as is the deep bowl. Be assured, if the thing starts to leak in future I will update this review accordingly; for now, 4 Stars.",

I dont really know what to label them, yet they seem to combine death and hardcore music (grindcore perhaps?) and put an interesting twist on things. Please dont listen to the reviewer that said that might sound somewhat like Hatebreed. Hatebreed is not a bad band, yet they are strictly modern hardcore, and Red Cord puts themself in another catorgory by sticking to a mostly \"Death/Grind\" Format. But to move on with the review, this is a really good album. It is a bit much to absorb at first as the combination of styles kinda plays with you, yet it seems to grow on you the more you listen. The Red Cord is a treat to extreme music, and hopefully they will continue to give us some great albums in the future. ENJOY",

I bought two sets at different times and neither set had any chips so the packaging for shipping was appropriate.3. They do seem to make things more moist when you soak them prior to using. I'm not sure you want this for ALL breads, but for pumpkin/banana that sort of thing it's awesome. I think you could not soak if you don't want the moisture.4. I haven't used them really often as I only bake for other people, not myself, but these are what I use now for any kind of recipe that I need a loaf pan for.5. I think they would be really cute to serve bread in at family parties.Quick review of instructions in case you've lost yours:Soak for 15 minutes in water prior to using. Start pans off in a COLD oven to gradually bring them to temp.**The first time I used these I forgot to do this and they didn't shatter, but it's probably not a good idea to take chances.",

You have to get a knife, and in the nut and saddle, thicken the wedges wear the strings go in, and make them deeper.Second, the standard tuning for a guitar is eadgbe. eadgbe on this size instrument will have to much slack with the strings because of the scale size. So there are to instruments that come similar to this. A guitalele made by yamaha(not sold in the U.S) and a requinto which is a mexican instrument that is also tuned to adgcea.

Readable not just for the historian, but the layman as well, the writing is superb. Snippets of information in side boxes offer amusing and informative anecdotes. One major strength of this work is that fact that the reader comes away with an idea of the Japanese perspective on the West, specifically the United States. Often either demonized or put on a pedestal by Westerners, this book provides insight into both the strengths and weaknesses of Japan as well as the West. The only drawback is that this book ends in the early 1990s, before the onset of deep recession in Japan. It would be of great value to get Dr. Boyle's perspective on the decade of the 90s and how the Japanese recession has affected Japan-US relations, as well as Japanese attitudes towards Japan itself.",

I agree with another reviewer that the ending was somehow less than what I expected, however, it also was one of those endings that leads the viewer to come to their own conclusion. You have nine people in a room and the truth is that they know each other, but they don't know how they know each other. On the surface, this is a suspenseful movie; underneath that, its a lesson about how the choices we make in life, affect the lives of others. Great movie!",

Barbeque is big business and Lou Jane Temple does as many other authors do, sets the characters and story line in a place she knows.Again, I recommend this series to anyone who likes an enjoyable mystery and wants some yummy recipes to add to their menus.",

Most of this frustration is caused by the manual being horrible at descirbing the required motions with the wiimote.However, once you figure out the controls, the game becomes quite fun. If anything, all you need is good coordination and a good memory to have fun (there are ALOT of different wiimote actions).After you get over the controls (it took me a day or two), you can concentrate on enjoying the game. Slow-motion leaps and dives, 30 foot superman-esque jumps off the wall to steal homers, etc. I've read complaints about the swing being delayed a bit compared to wii sports baseball. My answer? Deal with it! Anyone half good at video games will get used to it almost immediately. Some people just like to complain :).I've only had this game for a few days, and look forward to building up my rookie. So far I'm quite satisfied with my purchase.",

         "['One of the best albums of DATE Set aside copyright or CD issues. This is not the artists choice, this is a bigger problem with the whole record industry, and has nothing to do with a \"review\" about the music. I get the feeling some people have not actually taken the time and listened to this entire album before deciding to write some type of disgruntled review, which is ridiculous. This is one of those rare albums that each and every single song on there is absolutely amazing. The kind of CD you put in car and enjoy the ride, because each song makes you move and sing along. The kind of album you put in when friends are over and while they are moving to the beat they ask who it is because its like nothing they\\'ve heard before, but love it. I love music of all genres, from rock to hip hop to country, and this just hits on every mark. This is a brilliant album, and a brilliant artist.', 'Like finding buried treasure... Like any treasure, must be heard to be appreciated. Stop reading this review right now and buy it and listen to it as I am: songs you know by heart and thought you knew and that you hear again as if the first time, at once familiar and foreign. Best part: Bob forgetting the opening to \"I Don\\'t Believe You\" and having the audience feed him the line.Just amazing stuff from someone who continues to amaze, even DATE.So enough! I\\'ll leave the philosophizing and preaching to others. I\\'m going back to listen to the CD; I can\\'t get enough of it!', 'Unexpected triumph. I grabbed this album when it was released in DATE and have never grown tired of it. I recently bought the CD, since my cassette tape has long since worn thin. I was drawn to the album by \"Gentlemen Who Fell,\" which received enough airplay to capture my attentinon. I was pleasantly surprised, though, with the rest of the work. \"In a Glade\" became one of my favorites. Since her music is unique, I can only describe the work as a thoughtful, sometimes dark, but lyrically sound and musically engaging piece of art. As one of my favorite albums, I can\\'t say anything negative about this album. Not a mainstream work to appeal to the masses, it is an excellent collection. No regrets, only pleasant surprises. Definitely worth a listen.', 'A really good cd i\\'m going to have to go with the other reviews and say that this is an awesome cd, but but should not be your first They cd. The songs take some getting used to, but there are some real treasures - \"Hey, Mr. DJ\", \"Don\\'t Let\\'s Start\", and the wonderful Untitled Track NUM - for those of you who are not familiar with this, it is an actual recording from when you could leave a message at Dial-A-Song (NUM-NUM-NUM just a call to local brooklyn!), and a woman named Gloria didn\\'t realize her conference call was being recorded....anyway, if you like They, then get this cd. If not, get another one or two (i\\'d recommend Flood for a first one, or maybe Apollo NUM), then buy it!', 'Stellar! Five stars is just enough to describe this CD. If the word \"stellar\" is not enough, I would add \"uncompromising.\" Every track on the CD is a high-quality new experience you will be eager to repeat. You might find yourself completely addicted! I have not stopped listening to this one for DATE, and my changer usually has high turnaround.If it were necessary to pigeonhole the disc, the most likely fit is \"alternative power ballad,\" but expect more creative range and catchiness than that label would allow. What a strong voice my man Waymon has! When the group did a live spot for Atlanta\\'s radio station 99X, he had to stand back from the mic to prevent feedback. This is not overproduced alternative; it is genuine rock quality.', 'A Great CD!! I just brouth the cd DATE and i have played it non-stop since i got it. I heard of NFG before i got the cd but i never really heard anything from them. I had burned a cd with one of the songs from this album for one of my friends and i really liked the song so i decided to get the cd if i ever found it. Sowhen i found it i was thinking if i should get this CD or another one that was in my hand. I decided this CD and im damn sure happy i did. I think all the songs are great nd id say Hit or Miss and Boy Crazy are my favorite songs on the CD. Since i got it though i have not stoped playing it and i enjoy playing it cause when i am under the weather this is a godd CD to listen to to bring me back up so i say anyone should get this cd no matter hwat you listen to cause i myself love hardrock more than anything but this would have to be on top of my list of cds.', \"Simply Magnifficent What can I say?I wish I could give this ten stars.(...)Edie Brickell is my favourite female vocalist of all and I absolutely adore the youthful and sensual beauty of her angelic voiceNot only this the lyrics are very good .Edie ,who writes the lyrics, has a great turn of phrase , 'philosophy is a walk on the slippery rocksreligion is alight in the fog'and 'There's nothing I hate more than nothingNothing keeps me up at nightI toss and turn over nothingNothing can cause a great big fight'And DATE album is by far the best of Edie Brickell and The New BohemiansApart from 'the well known and wonderful 'What I Am' and 'Circle ' there are also other beautiful melodies like 'Little Miss S' , 'Air of DATE' ,'The Wheel' ,Love Like We Do' ,'Circle' ,Beat the Tune' and 'Nothing' I could listen for TIME and still want more.if you like good music I cannot recommend this one enough\", \"Why you have to love this record! Many of us G.L.J. fans wondered whatever became of Gene Loves J, after the fantastic early records Promise and Immigrant, they seemed to drift into a so-so sea of pop mediocrity, What became of the passion and originality of DATE, it's so apparent now! Love Lies Bleeding was clear a signal enough to what was missing all these years and Giving Up The Ghost is dna evidence of the genius lost. This is a remarkable document. So diverse and original and just magnificent. There are so many avenues explored, it's Pollack and Picasso too and poetic and street wise, it rOCKS!!! DATE the world will discover this Artist and I pray sooner than later because Michael deserves recognition above all who walk this landscape. Touching, passionate, tender and witty. Forget the name on the sleeve (A rose is a rose by any other name)CHECK THIS OUT!!\", \"One GREAT album This is a great CD. I love TIME of it. TIME of pure heaven.

I didn\\'t really care about the music at first, but now that I\\'ve listened to it I must say the music is in fact pretty good! I can\\'t really name anything comparable, but if you like rock music in general you should give this CD a try. In my case, it was totally worth it.

I actually had to return the item because the first one I received was defective (called Lowrance tech support and verified that in a matter of TIME when couldn't aquire any satelites), but Amazon made that process painless by shipping out a new one the day I called them about it and sending me a prepaid return label to return the defective one. I received my new item in DATE and it works great!! A lot of the other reviews mention problems with signal, but I live in the BOOOONNNIIEESS and have never lost signal once it is aquired (which never takes over two TIME or so). Even on DATE, this unit stays locked. I even sat it in the floorboard of the truck to see what would happen and it stayed locked. So...to all the naysayers I would state that this unit is well worth the money and has so far performed as well as the in car unit I used recently in a rental car during a trip to Germany. Great little unit.\", \"One of the best for the money This product was kind of difficult getting started, I had to call the help desk to have drivers downloaded to my computer once that was done it works absolutely great. The product was purchased for my 15yr old son who loves it dearly, he's constantly downloading music and there seems to be plenty of space left. He hasn't done any videos as of yet but I'm sure he will soon, overall we are satisfied with the product and I recommend it highly.\", \"It's perfect! We used this product during our entire trip to Ohio (TIME). Worked great. We had both the computer and the DVD player plugged in. Kept both me and our son happy. As for being loud - I have to disagree. We couldn't even hear it over the radio. Great product for the price.\", \"Sound Quality good, Price Great I bought NUM sets these to listen to music downloaded from archive.org and ripped MP3's on my Sansa Fuze. My wife uses them while working on and listening to music on her iPhone 3GS. I keep them at work, in the car for skiing or walks in the park, at home for working in the yard or riding a bike. I also have a one for the computer and listening to youtube of live concerts in HD. Durable design that I have been using for DATE. It is nice to have good quality sound that allows you to hear what is going on around you, or turn them up to hear crisp bass and clear highs. Having a convenient pair of headphones where you need them is better than than having a more expensive headphone worrying about them being stolen or broken during transport/storage.I may not have needed to buy so many, all are still working well with good sound quality and cords and ear foam that is still comfortable to wear.\", \"Great system... after NUM returns. I believe for the price its worth the money, but buyer beware it took me NUM returns to Crutchfield to find the perfect one. The first two systems kept on going black when playing back DVD movies.I recommend sending it back right away if you start to see this happening.I went with Crutchfield and not Amazon because Crutchfield return policy is great. All it took was a phone call to them and they right away sent me out a brand new system with prepaid postage with UPS.I must say the box is heavy, and living on a 3rd floor was quite a workout to get it up the my living room. But luckily all you need to replace is the main component.The sound is great and fills the room nicely. Also the quality via the HDMI cable is excellent.If you are looking for a FULL NUM effect don't expect this system to deliver. I didn't notice a real distinction between NUM channels. The quality of the sound makes up for the absence of that affect.\", \"Excellent high quality product Going into this purchase I have bought the Belkin PureAV line of products where available for my home entertainment system (all cables, surge protector) and have not been disappointed. And after this purchase that still remains the case. The switch works perfectly and looks and feels very well constructed. I have seen some people complain that there is no on/off switch but it doesn't really matter. There is no real need to turn it off. This thing at the worst is gonna cost you about $.NUM a month if left on at all times. The only cons that I could think of is that unlike all the other PureAV products I have purchased, this one was a little more on the high side compared to similar products. But I would rather pay those extra few dollars for peace of mind knowing that I am getting a high quality product that will do everything I need it to do.\"]",

There are several mini stories that intertwine. I also loved the different colored lenses for each story. The DVD has superb picture and sound quality.

The story moved quickly and kept my interest throughout, which is not an easy task. I loved the main characters and well as the secondary ones as well.

So I was very reluctant to read this the first time it was suggested to me DATE, but I did because I trusted the man who gave it to me, and I was desperately in need of hope...It's an easy read, but very hard to forget. It's still with me two-and-a-half decades later, and so is my family which was very much at risk during my 'hell' that led me to a place of listening.

It's one of those novels that is just written so well that you can't wait to get to the next chapter.What makes this novel work so well is the main character, who also narrates. John Corey tells the story with just enough wit to keep it entertaining. It is the wit that drives this story, even though there is more than enough action.If you liked Plum Island, and liked John Corey in that novel, then this is a must read.

The characters (especially Billy, who had a very limited voice) were very well developed, and the plot was well thought out. Many negative reviews focused on the \"lack of action.\" Does a novel need to be action packed to be good? If you think so, then stick to your MTV culture. CB is full of wonderful detail and exquisite storytelling. This novel deals with many issues that affect nearly all of us and should be read carefully. As far as those who criticize having to re-read passages, do you really want a book that doesn\\'t make you stop to think once in a while? Definately worthwhile, and deserving of a second reading by those who felt it \\'boring.\\'', \"I Liked This Intro to an Amazing Life It is sad that the errors that were noted by the other reviewers have marred the book. I did not know they were there and so what I got from this book was this fantastically gifted man and the passions of his life. This compact life is really full of drama. The monologues, debated in other comments, are based on the things Kelly expressed in other ways, as I understand it, but they weren't necessary. I was not bothered by the concise description of DATE of fizzles and disappointments in Kelly's later life. I can recommend this book as a very enjoyable read, and quite good for young readers, but it seems clear a big, fat, long, unimpeachably correct bio would make a lot of other people happy.\", 'slow start, good finish I bought the book based on the good reviews. After about a fourth of the book I was quite bored with it and went online to see if it was worth continuing. It seemed so. After the long, long part about the depression ends, the book becomes a real page-turner with some great insights into English and America culture. Very hard to put down and a very satisfying read!', \"Two Books in One I really enjoyed most of book... but it had an awkward pace.. Parts of it like the visit to Libby Hatches mothers house had me on edge. Other parts, like over descriptive dinner scenes were annoying. The end was disappointing. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it.. but a space ship could have landed to save DATE out of nowhere and had the same effect. I wish the ending had stayed with the story. The characters were great and saved the book, especially El Nino.\", 'Very readable Essentially there is nothing wrong with this book - in fact it is very compelling and readable and as such deserves a NUM star rating.Still in saying that I wonder what made Colleen write about such a religious event but duplicated in the future? It is not offensive in my mind but others who take the Christian religion seriously may see this book as blasphemy.Others like me who are not so worried will find this an easy and entertaining read that will leave you feeling a trifle sad about the world she has created in this novel.', \"Thoughtful book Like another reviewer, I agree that this is NOT the definitive treatise on the problems of the working poor but it takes a slice of the situation and analyzes it very well.We live well at the expense of others.That is a sobering thought. Moreover (though Ehrenreich doesn't go there at all) we do it not only at the expense of our fellow Americans but also global family members as well.On DATE when I had more time, it would be entertaining to read all of the one-star reviewers. Those reviewers will tell you more about themselves than the book. (I want to simultaneously apologize for that grossly biased remark, but many of those folks were unwilling to minutely face the costs attached to their life style and who pays).A thoughtful but quick read.\", 'Too Much Talk for My Tastes There\\'s lot of amusing insights into relationships here, combined with visuals by a very gifted artist.Unfortunately, the relationships ring hollow to me -- I just don\\'t believe in Anne, Ricky, and what\\'s-her-name as real people. They seem designed mainly for humour.The early part of the book is non-stop talking heads with little or no plot or action. The early chapters could be interchanged without much problem. The visuals liven up the succession of heads, but I found the artwork a little too lively; with shots from every angle, and expressions jumping from joy to angst in rapid succession.The latter half of the book livens up with Anne\\'s trip to LA and San Francisco. There was some action, and events that I could believe in.The road-trip elements at the end of the book might suggest \"Thelma and Louise\", but I believe this book was first published before the movie (?).', \"A good book that will rankle the close-minded This book is not perfect. For example, it seemes to me that Wills misunderstands Thoreau's use of irony, and I'm not sure the causal link between Reagan and abortion clinic bombings is as strong as Wills suggests. But most of the customers who have reviewed this book either NUM) haven't really read all the book or NUM) are hopelessly close minded.That said, I'll just add that Wills's latest book is a masterful analysis of the very fiber of American society. I don't know anyone who LOVES the government, but Wills shows why it is essential to our well-being, how it is a vital force in making this great country what it is. Few people know more about the Constitution than Wills, but he is not (as some readers suggest) a mere liberal pedant. Sometimes the truth hurts.\", 'A good read- but not if you\\'re looking for action. I\\'ll admit it. I HATED Hemingway after the mandatory \"Old Man and the Sea\" in high school, but when I saw this book, I had to give it a try, even if Hemingway was the author and I wasn\\'t dissapointed. It isn\\'t a plot filled with action or intrigue, but it is complex and fascinating in how it describes the personal relaitonships of the impotent protagonist Jake, his less than innocent love Brett, and the annoying tag-along Robert Cohn along with a slew of others that reminds me so much of the high school \"in crowd\" I started casting the characters with people I knew. It isn\\'t a book for everybody, in fact, unless you like working to understand meaning in a book this isn\\'t the one for you. However if you\\'re looking for more than a casual read you won\\'t be dissapointed. This is one of his very best.', 'Not bad, but wish for more... Some of the earlier chapter\\'s were well written and very intriguing, such as \"What if Jesus Had Lived?\" and \"China\\'s exploration carried further\". However some of it wasn\\'t all to interesting such as \"What if Hitler had lived?\", to sum it up as the book says, it wouldn\\'t matter, bleah!

Our daughter loved to turn the yellow sun which clicks, and the little orange ball. The teething ring is mostly ornamental, as we have owned far more effective ones. Still, the combination of activities, minimal noises, and no batteries (for once!) made it a parental favorite for us. In DATE and age of bells and whistles, it is refreshingly simple.The only thing we don't like about it is that it falls down very easily. We wish that they would make it more robust for standing, as that is a great feature for kids learning to move around and sit. As it is, it only works well laying down.\", \"Love it!-UPDATED I love this jumperoo. My daughter is a little young, DATE on DATE, but she loves the toys! She's a little short, so we're using blankets. My only thing is the elephant is backwards. My daughter is looking at the backside of the elephant, I thought that was strange. But other than that, the seat rotates pretty easy and the toys seem to be good quality. :) Very happy with this jumperoo!UPDATE: My babygirl is loving this jumperoo more and more over time!

His feet don't hit the ground, but he has to bend over to hold the handle bars, and especially when he stands to push it, he practically has to bend in half. I can't imagine how small the small size must be. Everything about this toy is just about perfect except for the height of the handlebars. I would like them to be about NUM inches higher. I think they would still be comfortable for most babies, I've noticed in most of the pictures, the babies hands are reaching pretty far down to grab the bar, so I don't think it's just because my baby is tall. I LOVE that the wheels turn so easily. They toy is much lighter weight than I expected, which is nice. It's still heavy enough to keep baby from getting ahead of himself.

The only things I didn't like about it were that after you get past mission NUM, it gets too hard and every time you get killed, you have to start all the way over in that level. It's fun flying and killing the enemies and the boss levels are a lot of fun, but Buck has to be the slowest walker ever made when you try combat from the ground. The insects and graphics are done pretty well, but they could be a little bit better. The sound is probably the best attribute to the game other than the fun factor.To keep it from getting too boring, there's a NUM player soccer game that makes this game a lot better. If you want a challenging shooting/adventure game, this could be a good game to get.\"]",

So why the pain? Because, in order to get the Lost Disc, you have to purchase the entire thing all over again, which is an unnecessary expense to the many who already have the NUM-Disc Collectors Edition. I'm not sure if the good folks at Buena Vista considered how this will result in many of the original NUM-Discers ending up in a lot of Used DVD bins. Normally, that would be fine, but the people who are going to want the NUM-Discer (as opposed to the Single Disc, Just-The-Movie edition) are going to be the obsessive extras collectors who will therefore want the Lost Disc.The Lost Disc extras are great, but would it not have been at least a bit more convenient to put out the Lost Disc as a single component?\", \"Great Film, DVD bonus lacking... Film: Bonuses: Amazing chapter in the evangelion rebuild, a must see and must own for any Eva fan.Unfortunately like many anime companies they still don't know how to make a dvd with decent extras. All you get are some production screens, some production vids where they show you a scene's evolution from concept to final(sounds good on paper but was in dull in execution)It would have been nice to have vignettes with the cast and crew about the behind the scenes making of the film... the commentary was mildly amusing at least.This isn't bashing the film, it is top notch providing new experiences and intrigue for Eva fans for the first time in DATE I highly recommend, and I was very happy with my purchase, its just sad that the bonus features didn't match the quality of the film itself is all I only criticize in hopes that it helps anyone better understand this aspect of their purchase...\", \"Poor quality, great series!

It's beautiful. So I highly recommend it, just be sure to play the disks con your Blu Ray!\", \"alternate version is by far the best version. I saw this at the cinema and while I enjoyed it annoyed me a little because certain elements of the story didn't add up. However the alternate version which has a different third act clears those up, in fact it is very different. In fact I find it amazing that this was not the version shown at the cinema.The features are all interesting enough and the picture quality is very good too. A worthwhile ourchase on blu ray.\", 'Worth every penny...almost The extended version of the film is fantastic for fans of the theatrical release. It fleshes out the characters and scenes and is every bit as enjoyable as the first. However, people should be warned against buying the gift set as opposed to the plain DVD. After being duped into buying the theatrical release with practically no bonus material DATE, I was determined not to make that mistake again. However, what I didn\\'t realize that the only difference between the gift set and the regular DVD is the Argonath statuettes and the National Geographic DVD \"Beyond the Movie\", which may be a fabulous disc, but hardly worth more than twice the price. Buy the special edition, it is a must-own, but don\\'t waste your money on the \"gift set\", it is only a gift to the studio, just like the first DVD release.', 'A Much Needed Update The stale and lifeless special effects of the DATE\\'s may have dazzled fans then but DATE they would fall flat on a more expereinced audience. In DATE CGI, would you accept a puppet espousing universal wisdom or wooden and stiff sword fighting? Of course not.George Lucas delivers to the fans, old and young, new and veteran, freshly polished and retuned trilogies. The new krayt dragon call is clearer and more chilling despite the scoffs of so called \"fans.\" The scene of Vader defeating the Emperor has been improved and now linked to the end of the \"Revenge of the Sith\" almost like the meter of an epic poem.Improved audio and increased clarity with vibrant colors are to be expected with a Blu-Ray release. What makes this a \"must buy\" is this is a re-telling of an already masterful story.A star off because of the packaging. It\\'s too filmsy and I have to imagine a future released will have something more sturdy.', 'Movie is a classic, blu ray treatment of it doesn\\'t add much I have always loved John Wayne movies,and considered \"The Searchers\" to be one of the best. My opinion of that remains unchanged, however, I didn\\'t see much different between the standard DVD version and the blu ray version of this movie. My TV, TV cables, and blu ray player are all top of the line and I have watched other blu ray discs on it and have been wowed by the detail and clarity. This movie didn\\'t really offer much more then the standard DVD version. It\\'s only priced a few more dollars above the standard DVD so its not that much of a risk and if you want the newest version of this movie, you will have it, but if you want to save a few bucks and get the same quality picture just go with the Standard DVD version. I don\\'t think this is anyone\\'s fault, I just think that the movie technology of the DATE\\'s doesn\\'t convert well to Blu ray, but thats just one guys opinion. Either way the movie is excellent.', 'Good, but not perfect I was thrilled to finally be purchasing one of my favorite \"musicals\" of all times, especially at the thought of enjoying The Wall in Dolby Digital NUM surround-sound. While the musics tracks of the DVD were awesome, as well as some of the special effects (explosions, etc.), the dialogue was poorly mixed in with the soundtrack requiring me to constantly adjust the volume (quite annoying).The picture was clear enough, and altogether it was a good experience. Any die-hard fan of The Wall will truly appreciate the enhancements of Dolby Digital as well as the sharp digital picture. I highly recommend it - just be ready with the remote for those volume adjustments.', \"biollante blu ray i bought both dvd and blu ray of this movie, been waiting forever for this. the blu ray picture is good, considering its a DATE movie, and its a godzilla movie, it does say DATE on the box, maybe the original films/transfers were not as good? though imo the destroy all monsters blu ray might have had a better picture. the english dub is low mono. i had to turn up my surround sound way up to hear it. but i did switch between english and japanese to see if it was the disk itself. and it is only the english version that is low, the japanese sounds amazing. the movie is in widescreen and my dvd does say widescreen on it too. being this was only NUM for blu ray and NUM for dvd i can't really complain. they did a great job with this release and i'm happy to finally own it on blu ray/dvd. godzilla fans will love this, and we can finally retire our old vhs tapes.\"]",

The music isn't as cheezy as most of them, and I think it's quite inspirational now. This workout starts out slowly, and then it picks up. What I like about it is if I don't feel up to it, I can keep my feet on the floor (not jump if I don't want to) and still feel like I had a good workout. I usually only do the aerobic portion which is only NUM mins, but there's also a toning portion targeting all those fun areas. This workout is definitly in my rotation of workouts.\", \"An oldie but a goodie I've had this dvd for DATE and its one I keep coming back to. If it had some exercises for chest and back it would be perfect. (Which is why it only gets NUM, instead of NUM stars from me). As it is, a great workout that you can mix and match to make it as tough as you want. The exercises are solid and Tamilee really knows her stuff. Definitely a classic you should have in your exercise library.\", 'Excellent conditioning This is a great workout DVD for strength and dance conditioning; it is quite a challenge the first few times,and left me sore for DATE - which, in a workout, is a desirable outcome. I highly recommend it.', \"Great Mix I always enjoy the workouts that Prevention puts together - there's so much variety that you will certainly not get bored. Your heartrate will be up, but I was never gasping for breath (which is good!) Chris definitely has a cheerful personality that isn't overwhelming. She's encoraging, motivating, and makes you hit all the areas of your body. If your looking something that really intense, this video isn't it, but I still feel it's a decent workout. And it's broken up into seperate segments, so if you are crunched for time you can just do what your in the mood for.\", \"LOVE IT! Great mix of cardio and weights. I really feel it when I'm done with this work out. She does move through the workout fast but once you get teh steps down you'll really appreciate the fast pace. I would highly recommend this workout video.\", \"Great prenatal workout! If you're looking for a prenatal workout video that isn't only yoga, this is a really great one. I like the TIME salsa portion, which is really more like a typical aerobics class that has been toned down for expectant mothers. Then there's also the TIMEs of yoga, which is also so great in getting your lungs and mind more prepared for childbirth. The final two parts - Preparing for Birth, and Stretching/Relaxation are the best I have found in any of the prenatal videos I have tried so far. She doesn't push, but keeps reminding you to go at your own pace, take breaks as needed, and to listen to what your body is telling you. I didn't get this video until the start of my third trimester, but I will be sure to use it throughout my 2nd & 3rd trimester the next time around.\", \"Amazing I've done a lot of workout DVDs and Jillian Michaels' are by far my favorites. I don't need to lose a lot, maybe another NUM-NUM lbs, but really wanted to tone up. I started with her DATE Shred and just received her No More Trouble Zones, which I did for the first time DATE. OMG! I have NEVER felt the effects of a workout like this, and I LOVE it. My obliques are even sore, which is so reassuring that I've actually worked them! I was dripping sweat by the end. I can't wait to do it again!! And I am excited to see how I'll look and feel in DATE. HELLO SUMMER!\", \"Pretty Hardcore for TIME I bought this DVD because even though I work out every day for a little over an hour, it was more like zoning-out. That having been said, even for a more Intermediate-Advanced exerciser like myself, it is VERY high impact. If you're nursing some injuries, even old ones, this may not be for you. I know that after jumping up-and-down for TIME straight my ancient hip injury started to bother me again. Truthfully, I will probably only do this workout when I don't have time for a trip to the gym. But I find her encouraging remarks and approach to exercise useful and will apply it to my regular workout.\"]",

         "[\"Great camera for most casual users I got this camera DATE and have used it in both indoor and outdoor settings. It takes great pictures, the controls are very easy to figure out but spending TIME with the manual is a good idea. I like the way it feels and where the position of the zoom and shutter are located. At the highest resolution, file sizes have been between NUM and NUM meg. The digital zoom is great - I used it at my son's baseball game and was able to zoom in on an outfielder and get some great shots. Redeye only works in portrait mode - not auto mode (unless I just haven't found the right setting). Flash doesn't automatically pop up when you need it but it will display an icon when you need it. That auto-pop is really the only thing I wish it had. LOVE that the lcd swings out and swivels. This is overall a GREAT camera for those who want something better than your average point and shoot but don't want to spend the $ for the SLR.\", \"User friendly and great results I have been interested in photography for DATE, but this is the first good quality camera I have ever owned. I found this camera very easy to use right out of the box. After TIME I got up the courage to take the camera of auto and see what else it could do. I found the menus easy to navigate and was able to produce great results with DATE of practice. The macro setting is amazing and the anti shake feature lives up to its promise. I haven't even needed to use a tripod. I am extremely happy with my purchase and look forward to getting many DATE of use out of this camera.\", \"Excellent I had had this camera for DATE now and I can't tell you had much I love it. It has many more fetures than I would ever use but there are some drawbacks to this item. First, in low light conditions you must hold this camera steady after pushing the button or your pics come out blurred. Other than that it is a well made product.\", \"The Best of the Best I've had NUM cameras in DATE and this, by far, is the best. It's easy to use, takes good pictures, and yet, if you want to get more complicated, you can do your own settings. And, the optical lens is wonderful. This is a keeper.\", \"Great Price, Great Capacity, Good Performer on EOS 5D Nothing else beats 8gb under $NUM, on my Canon 5D JPEG capacity NUM,NUM. Memory speed is not a concern due to memory buffer on 5D, erasing and browsing on camera is acceptable a bit slower than extreme III. On the computer with card reader is as fast as any microdrive and slower than extreme III, the same goes for erasing and browsing. Reliability, I took NUM+ pictures without a single glitch (Raw and JPEG). Finally you can put an entire session on a single card. Burst shooting 3fps up to NUM+ pictures (testing) in real life I never take more than NUM.I'll recommended to anyone, Great Price, Great Capacity...\", \"As a pro still photographer... As a professional still photographer just entering the digital camcorder field (I own a digital camera), I viewed this camera with the same eye that I use to shoot publication quality photographs. I really like it's qualities - highly recommend it to my peers and serious amatuers.It's Canon optical 26x zoom is truly awesome and the ability to record in total darkness amazes me. The 'image stabaliztion' really works and the fact that it is a little larger than some digital camcorders is a plus. Size and heft helps stabalize it in hand held situations.\", \"DATE On and Still Going Strong Hard to believe it's been DATE, but my Powershot A510 has served me incredibly well. It has shot about NUM,NUM photos, TIME of video. It has been dropped twice by accident, from about NUM feet on to concrete both times, been exposed to subfreezing weather, NUM degree weather, flown in an open cockpit biplane, dented and finish worn, but it still takes very good photographs.One of the first smaller cams with 4x zoom, and the Digic I processor ensures very good pictures. Full manual control is also nice. How good is the picture quality? I found that when mounted on a tripod, the A510 would take sharper pictures than a EOS Digital Rebel using a $NUM wide-angle lens. Compacts have matched lens/sensor pairs and this is a good example.The only negative features- Limited 640x480 video time to TIME, pretty chunky overall.This little Canon has outlasted two other point and shoots, a Kodak V705, and a Coolpix S570.Recommended, even at DATE.\", 'Does everything I need and more! Good:much smaller than I expected. It slides easily into a coat pocket.great image quality. Even a novice/lazy photographer like me can get amazing pictures!easy to use (see above)Bad:battery dies when connected to the computer. Buy a spare.software program not intuitive. Also--\"Olympus Master\"? Creepy. I edit in the camera or using MS Photo Editor or Photoshop.no viewfinder means sometimes you\\'re not sure what you\\'re shooting. It\\'s more than a mild annoyance, but in balance it\\'s okay because you\\'re getting a great camera at a reduced price.', \"Great Choice I started looking on many sites trying to decide...different recording formats,zoom,still pictures etc.....however the HD is the SUPER best as far as i am concern....I got a steal of a deal...in fact I owe the manufactures money..It is easy to use even my DATE daughter has NO problem operating...the ZOOM is perfect...the still pictures are not great however I have digital camera for that purpose....i think the best things about this device are .NUM How compact and easy to use .NUM No need to worry about finding the spot you last recorded it does it for you .NUM The movies direct to TV or on CD's are GREAT......I love this HD CAMCORDER....\", \"What a GREAT camera I think some people are very hard to pleaseI have nothing bad to say about the TX1.IT shoots great still a FANTASTIC video!The snap on the fly feature is wonderful. I'm left handed and find the controls easy to use left or right handed. Thanks canon this camera is the party animals dream!IF you're a Pro or looking to make a FEATURE FILM for hollywood. Don't buy this camera.If you are looking for a fun do all still video cam that will fit in your pocket.I say this is the one.THANKS CANON!!!!Now how about a selphy printer and stand alone DVD burner combo to go with it?\"]",

Songs that are plain awful are \\'Bomb\\', \\'Testosterone\\', \\'Monkey\\', and \\'Alien\\'. To much \"whining\" from the lead singer and not a mealody to be found from the guitarist ! I call this a dirty trick, figuring that this is the same group that came up with excellent songs such as \\'Everything Zen\\' and \\'Comedown\\'. These songs show so much craftsmanship that I would expect the same from all (or most) of the songs. It just doesn\\'t happen ! Figuring \\'Razorblade Suitcase\\' and \\'Deconstructed\\' are failures for this band - I think we will be seeing them in DATE on VH1\\'s WHERE ARE THEY NOW segments.', 'not worth the star i gave it Well boys and girls the next time you look up the word mistake you will see a picture of me holding this CD.

When I bought it I thought I was gonna get some smooth tunes maybe something to relax to but, NO!!! instead what I got was the worst display of.... \"I sold out and, now that my name can sell CD\\'s who cares what I sell\" .....For those who like this CD I recomend a check up at your nearest Physicians A.S.A.P you might have Mono good luck but get a difrent CD', \"Very disappointing to me I am a very, very big Elliott Smith fan and have been for DATE, the kind who has every recording, live, bootleg, videos of him playing, saw him live, read his biography, etc. I am selling my copy of this album without even ripping it because there isn't a single song on it that does anything new with the music or is in any way better than the originals. In short, they all suck. Waste of time, waste of money. But hey, maybe it's just me.....\", \"I wish there was the zero star option This album does not even deserve the praise of one mesely star. The music was just some computer recreation of Britney's songs. I thought the days of synthesizing music was over, apparently not! I can't believe people buy this garbage, they don't play instruments, I don't even know if there is a band. The lyrics are laughable (not that they even write them) and their voices are poor at best. To call these guy musicians or even artists should offend anyone with a brain.

(sigh)I hate doing a negative review of a CD by an artist I really like, but this thing sucks. The remastering is first class; the sound is really good. But some #@& decided to take Richard's LAST GOOD LP and re-sequence the songs, add songs that weren't on the vinyl album, delete ones that were on it - and worst of all - FADE OUT A SONG BEFORE IT'S FINISHED (Poor Dog).It's an insult to Little Richard, who has seen so many of his songs mistreated. If you liked your vinyl version, don't buy this. If you've heard about this legendary LP and want it on CD, don't buy this one. Like I said, it hurts, but what I say is true!

Steer clear...\", 'Pretend this one wasn\\'t made I have not heard Kerplunk, but probably out of Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod, Warning, and American Idiot, this is the only one I would truly label as bad (Nimrod was better, but not great either).

It also was trying a little too hard to preserve the \"I\\'m still punk\" notion which fortunately DATE gave up DATE.I have known for a long time that Billie Joe was never the best guitar player, (except the guitar playing is pretty good now)and Brain Stew\\'s refrain that is supposed to sound like a ticking clock is very bad. It sounded even worse in the live album, Bullet in the Bible.Geek Stink Breath is really the only other song on this album I liked. However, its too short and the guitar playing way too simple.In general, unless you are a major DATE fan, there really isn\\'t much you\\'re missing in this album.', \"load, reload, and pull the trigger fellas...its over I thought load and reload were bad. Now I'm begging for their return. There's no difference between this [stuff] and any of the nu-metal [stuff] thats been so popular lately. I popped ride the lightning into my cd player just to remember what they used to sound like. This isnt a return to anything, just another.... attempt by the band to evolve into something more mainstream. This cd has no solid intro's, no good guitar solo's, and no good lyrics. Some people are saying the drums are really good on this album, but all it sounds like to me is a DATE banging on a pot with a spoon. Even the best song on the cd, St. Anger, is worse than anything they've ever produced before. Hetfield's voice is just horrible. I can't stand what they've turned into; a bunch of money grubbin' has beens. I own every cd they've ever made but I refuse to buy this one. Maybe I'll download it - just to pay homage to the band and their recent efforts.\", \"All the songs sound the same I didn't buy this album. Although I don't think it's nessesary since it seems Everclear is planning on airing all their songs on the radio anyway. All I have to say is that I can't believe almost nobody notices that all the sons use the same chords, over and over again. The only reason I gave this CD an extra star its because some of the lyrics are good and were written with a good purpose, although expressed through a bad medium. I honestly think there's room for improvement... A LOT of room.\"]",

If you want to feel that you have spent TIME of your day in a wasted effort, i highly recommend you give this book a read. It leaves you unfulfilled, depressed, and somewhat confused.

However, upon reading it I was more disappointed than delighted. I felt like the author was trying too hard to be deep and profound. Often times the story would abruptly end and I would be left wondering if there was symbolic or poetic value in it ending where it did, or whether the author just got tired of writing and so ended the story. However, unwilling to leave this book without having given it every chance to redeem itself (or rather, the author, not the book) I read until the very end. I suppose I found in the last story \"Parker Swells\" some remnants of a decent story and so the book is the better for this story.

The idea is, in theory, brilliant, but despite my plodding, persisting and struggling through the pages, I found nothing to suggest it was anything other than - dare I say, amateur. It didn't hang together, it made absolutely no sense and the plots were just fantastical and unrealistic. I won't deny Mitchell's undeniable talent as a critically acclaimed and esteemed author, it's just this book......One of the reviews I read on this site was from someone who had read it and wanted to claim their life back for TIME wasted on reading it. I share this sentiment, having chosen it as the only fiction to bring on my Spanish holiday. Sadly, I feel completely ripped off, conned even.

In a scene where the main character has her first meeting with the vampires, the narrative gets so wrapped up in her talking about the past that I could barely follow what was going on. At a pivotal scene such as this, I expected much better writing. Since the author failed to deliver, I felt it not worth my time or effort to keep on reading. Getting even this far in the book was a struggle and a chore for me. I was bored and did not feel any interest for the main character and her obsession with baking.

The King quote and the favorable reviews had me anxious to read this, but the story just doesn't pan out. The evil starts to manifest itself with aberrant sexual behavior and torture, and then...just does the same thing over and over again. It's a one trick pony. And the characters, oy! Gifford Stevens, the professor of comparative literature and high explosives (!), is nothing but a cypher, a plot device, and the others don't fare much better. Key plot points happen off-screen, mainly because Little either couldn't explain them logically or didn't want to take the time.

I'm usually really good at knowing too what I'll like, but sadly from the beginning this book was an epic failure. The character's were hard to follow because there were so many and so much bouncing around. I didn't connect with any of them on an intimate level. There were times that I would have to back track because I got so bored reading that I paid no attention to what I read. There were grammar errors throughout the book and it was so cheezy that I was at times embarrassed I was reading it.I'm halfway through the book now and will not be finishing it.

It was the most corny and predictable plot I have encountered since middle school. I had never read Patterson before, but having heard such great things and seeing that he is always on the best sellers list, I decided to give this a try. What a complete waste of time. I thought it stunk a few chapters in. but continued because I thought it would get better. It never did, and in fact, it got worse and more unrealistic as the plot went on. The latter parts of the book are cheesier than a soap opera. I don't want to give anything away in case someone out there is crazy enough to want to waste their life away, but the ending is absolutely ridiculous. Please don't buy this book.

It started trapping ingredients and slipping when full like another reviewer mentioned.NUM) even worse, the body filled with a little water. This was from hand washing, no dishwasher. No way to remove the water.After DATE with the cannister filled with water, the black base popped off. Another reviewer mentioned the same problem.The concept is great, the execution is poor. I really wanted to love this thing.', \"Don't Be Fooled I read all the reviews for this Espresso Maker, and decided that the good out weighed the bad... WHAT A MISTAKE.

I followed all the direction to the letter (don't leave the handle attedched when not in use, ect...). but after DATE it BREAKS!! For no reason at all one day it started to leak a ton of water while brewing and was unfixable. Since it had worked fine at first I no longer had a box and could not return it or send it in.

It was difficult to open the lid at first. When I finally got to open it, the plastic \"screw-like thing\" at the back broke.

It was making this really noisy gurgling sound that scared the hell out of me -maybe it is normal but I have never experienced such a thing from other coffeemakers. The first time I used the product, it produced NUM mug of coffee - at least that pleased me. But after that first time, it was only producing NUM/NUM of a cup. I have to re-start the machine again and again in order to fill my mug. Since I live in Europe, there is no point in returning the product and wasting more money.

Finally, my unit always left a slightly burnt scum on the bottom of the unit that built up after successive runs.

Too many artifacts (blobs of dust) and jerky movements. The sound was muddy. For films with snappy dialogue, these were a disappointment. Closed captioning was not available.A side note, I usually check for closed-captioning before I purchase a DVD, this time I was too enticed by the low price. Generally, inclusion of CC indicates slightly better quality DVD production. And, NO, simply turning up the TV volume does not help.', 'Good miniseries, horrible transfer The dvd transfer is absolutely horrible. I received two copies, one a replacement, and both were very poor transfers. On side B, the transfer became even worse. Also, the dvd is supposed to be widescreen, my two copies were full frame.

However, they cannot guarantee the dvd quality.', \"Extremely poor notification! I had waited a long time for this movie to come out in DVD.

This blu ray, however, is deplorable. No top menu or pop up menu, no supplements, and no subtitles would make this a bad disc, but believe it or not, this disc doesn't even let you pause, rewind or fast forward. There are no Chapters you can scan through. That's right. When you start the movie, you better be ready to watch it straight through without even a bathroom break. NO PAUSE! No rewind to see what you've missed. I feel royally hipped.

My first minor complaint is the voiceover narration. I can understand why yoga instructors choose this format, but I guess I'm partial to live instruction. Perhaps I would have found the voiceover narration more tolerable had this dvd been setup differently. A mix-n-match option sounds like a potentially great idea, but the routines on this dvd are choppy and repetitive. My biggest complaint is the constant use of props.

Even with those, I found myself waiting around and sighing.I cant believe there arent more reviews of annoyed viewers!\", \"don't waste your time and money The book is so confusing and complicated. It will take me hours, maybe days, to read all the instructions for each move and learn the sequence. I have read many exercise books and this one is so awful. You really need the DVD for the Total Workout. The DVD costs $NUM on her website. So ridiculously expensive!

         "[\"The worst pictures I have ever seen DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. . . at least, don't buy this camera if you want to actually have decent pictures to print and keep for a lifetime and for generations to come. I actually read the manual and learned how to use all the features and still NUM% of the pictures I've taken over DATE are blurred or very pixillated. Yes, I modified the pixels to the highest resolution and am still having issues. If you want a cheap camera, and don't care about having quality pictures to preserve, then this is the camera for you. If not, save the $NUM+ dollars you would have spent, and budget for a more expensive, higher quality camera. I'm sending mine back and upgrading. One positive note is the Camedia software. I've used it with a higher quality Olympus camera (a lot more $) which was stolen from me DATE, and I really love it; which is why I'm staying with the Olympus brand, despite the poor quality of the D-Series model.\", 'Gawd Has Foresaken me... I got this camera very quickly, service was fantastic. I say this because any retailer who sells these shouldnt feel too responsible for the sin that is this camera. I have had my dealings with NUM.2mp cameras, some made in DATE and I am very appalled to have used this camera and to get this kind of low quality shot.Pictures are blurry. Well unless you use the flash, then they are completely \"pixelated\" and are engulfed in white.This is not a deal for the money, it doesnt even serve its purpose as a camera.I will say I love the design of the camera, and this just makes me want apple to delve into the camera industry.Conclusion: dont purchase this if you\\'re looking for something to take pictures with. If you want to load this on your computer and waste your time, go for it, otherwise, buy anything else.', \"Terrible Camera I purchased this camera not even DATE and recently sold it. This is the worst camera I've ever had. It constantly, no matter what setting I had on, underexposed the lighting in pictures, most of the time ruining the shot. Lighting is basically a photographer's lifeblood. And it's too big and bulky. The only good thing about this camera is how the clarity and sharpness are from such high megapixels. That's about it.Do NOT buy this camera, because you'll be sorry. I'm sorry I spent the NUM dollars I did to get this piece of junk. Unless your not a bigtime photographer, you can take just as good shots with a cheap point and shoot camera.\", \"What's the Big Deal? Yes, it's nice to have a NUM mm lens on an auto-everything camera, but other than that, I don't really understand what the big deal (the raves of other reviewers) is with this camera. The pictures are not any sharper than with my Olympus Stylus Zoom, the exposures are not that great under many conditions, it is very difficult -- if not impossible -- to stop the zoom where you want to in the middle of its range, and -- worst of all for me -- the camera comes pre-set with a printable (wrong) date, that unless you reset or erase it will ruin all of your photos!! I stupidly took this camera on vacation without testing it first and shot eleven rolls of film with it. I sure wish I had taken my Olympus instead.\", \"Not good! I don't think that this camra is very good, I took pictures and the dpi is really bad it's too big and the pictures look really bad also. I was amazed how fast the Batteries ran out. I suggest you don't buy this.\", \"BEWARE I would beware not only the camera, but of Amazon.....after having this camera for DATE, we had problems with it. We were on vacation in CA and had to buy a new camera. When we returned home we could not return the camera, Optio NUM, to Amazon because of their DATE return policy. We are now stuck with NUM ditigal camera's. Not sure what is wrong with the optio, but it does not focus for you. It is a common problem,as stores I call have had the same problems. I bought a Kodak one, and love it even better. So be becareful on your electronics from Amazon. Their return policy is stupied, and I will never buy anything from them again. Their loss. I lived on shopping with them. Oh well. I just hope I can save people from making the mistake I made......\", 'Horrible... I used this camera for a DATE untill during a period of DATE of not being turned on, something to do with the light sensor malfunctioned. I think all Canon ZR series cameras are inclined to having buggy hardware and I dont remcomend buying one.', \"Buy something else I went for a[n] [inexpensive] camera rather than one I knew anything about - my mistake. I've tried three roles of film in this camera, and in two of the roles only a couple of pictures turned out. The rest of the negatives were completely blank! The other roll (the middle one that I tried) actually had pictures on it, but they were poor quality - dark, grainy, and out of focus. I am not an expert photographer, but I certainly think I should be able to do better than this; obviously this is not a high-performance camera. ...\", \"This piece of junk died on me Usually, I have good experiences with Toshiba's products. For example, I have a Toshiba DVD player that I am very happy with. However, this digital camera was a disappointment in almost every aspect. A minor gripe was the short battery life, but that's a very common problem with digital cameras in general. Major problem #NUM: This camera has a VERY hard time focusing in low-light situations. Unless you're in a brightly lit room or outside on DATE, your pictures stand a good chance of being out of focus. Major problem #NUM: I owned this camera DATE when it refused to recognize the existence of batteries. I tried many different types of fresh batteries, but it says they're all dead. Now I have to look into getting warranty service. If I had it to do over, I would have invested a little more in a higher-quality camera (and a brand other than Toshiba). You really do get what you pay for when it comes to digital cameras.\", 'disappointing After DATE of light use, the camera stopped working. Also, the output format was very difficult to work with.
