The first third is true to the form of A Sailor of Austria. An edifying slice of history told in a delightful fashion. Every page includes something fascinating about the Austro Hungarian empire as well as something laugh out loud funny. The other two thirds don't achieve the same level though.

So far, it seems to be doing quite well. I was a bit leary of the way the pump fits into the faountain (from the bottom, through a hole in the body of the bowl), but the O-ring seems to be doing its job and I've not detected any leaks yet. (That said, I'd have been more comfortable with a design where the pump inserted from the top, into a 100% sealed bowl-unit, as with the FreshFlow.)The filters for these units have not been bastardised (yet) as those for the FreshFlows have been; when it comes to my beloved pet I will not tolerate any cost-cutting tomfoolery with the design. The huge reservoir is a plus, as is the deep bowl. Be assured, if the thing starts to leak in future I will update this review accordingly; for now, 4 Stars.",

I dont really know what to label them, yet they seem to combine death and hardcore music (grindcore perhaps?) and put an interesting twist on things. Please dont listen to the reviewer that said that might sound somewhat like Hatebreed. Hatebreed is not a bad band, yet they are strictly modern hardcore, and Red Cord puts themself in another catorgory by sticking to a mostly \"Death/Grind\" Format. But to move on with the review, this is a really good album. It is a bit much to absorb at first as the combination of styles kinda plays with you, yet it seems to grow on you the more you listen. The Red Cord is a treat to extreme music, and hopefully they will continue to give us some great albums in the future. ENJOY",

I bought two sets at different times and neither set had any chips so the packaging for shipping was appropriate.3. They do seem to make things more moist when you soak them prior to using. I'm not sure you want this for ALL breads, but for pumpkin/banana that sort of thing it's awesome. I think you could not soak if you don't want the moisture.4. I haven't used them really often as I only bake for other people, not myself, but these are what I use now for any kind of recipe that I need a loaf pan for.5. I think they would be really cute to serve bread in at family parties.Quick review of instructions in case you've lost yours:Soak for 15 minutes in water prior to using. Start pans off in a COLD oven to gradually bring them to temp.**The first time I used these I forgot to do this and they didn't shatter, but it's probably not a good idea to take chances.",

You have to get a knife, and in the nut and saddle, thicken the wedges wear the strings go in, and make them deeper.Second, the standard tuning for a guitar is eadgbe. eadgbe on this size instrument will have to much slack with the strings because of the scale size. So there are to instruments that come similar to this. A guitalele made by yamaha(not sold in the U.S) and a requinto which is a mexican instrument that is also tuned to adgcea.

Readable not just for the historian, but the layman as well, the writing is superb. Snippets of information in side boxes offer amusing and informative anecdotes. One major strength of this work is that fact that the reader comes away with an idea of the Japanese perspective on the West, specifically the United States. Often either demonized or put on a pedestal by Westerners, this book provides insight into both the strengths and weaknesses of Japan as well as the West. The only drawback is that this book ends in the early 1990s, before the onset of deep recession in Japan. It would be of great value to get Dr. Boyle's perspective on the decade of the 90s and how the Japanese recession has affected Japan-US relations, as well as Japanese attitudes towards Japan itself.",

I saw this when it was broadcast on PBS. It presents a Soviet view of the war with all that entails but you really can't overdramatize what happened there.",

I agree with another reviewer that the ending was somehow less than what I expected, however, it also was one of those endings that leads the viewer to come to their own conclusion. You have nine people in a room and the truth is that they know each other, but they don't know how they know each other. On the surface, this is a suspenseful movie; underneath that, its a lesson about how the choices we make in life, affect the lives of others. Great movie!",

As any developing mystery series I expect the characters to expand as the series does. If you find out everything about a character at the beginning of the series what is there to discover later? Barbeque is big business and Lou Jane Temple does as many other authors do, sets the characters and story line in a place she knows.Again, I recommend this series to anyone who likes an enjoyable mystery and wants some yummy recipes to add to their menus.",

I think it stinks that you have to buy extra screens and rainguards for strollers when you will ovbiously need these items! Other than that this stroller has been a lifesaver.

Most of this frustration is caused by the manual being horrible at descirbing the required motions with the wiimote.However, once you figure out the controls, the game becomes quite fun. If anything, all you need is good coordination and a good memory to have fun (there are ALOT of different wiimote actions).After you get over the controls (it took me a day or two), you can concentrate on enjoying the game. Slow-motion leaps and dives, 30 foot superman-esque jumps off the wall to steal homers, etc. I've read complaints about the swing being delayed a bit compared to wii sports baseball. My answer? Deal with it! Anyone half good at video games will get used to it almost immediately. Some people just like to complain :).I've only had this game for a few days, and look forward to building up my rookie. So far I'm quite satisfied with my purchase.",

         "['One of the best albums of DATE Set aside copyright or CD issues. This is not the artists choice, this is a bigger problem with the whole record industry, and has nothing to do with a \"review\" about the music. I get the feeling some people have not actually taken the time and listened to this entire album before deciding to write some type of disgruntled review, which is ridiculous. This is one of those rare albums that each and every single song on there is absolutely amazing. The kind of CD you put in car and enjoy the ride, because each song makes you move and sing along. The kind of album you put in when friends are over and while they are moving to the beat they ask who it is because its like nothing they\\'ve heard before, but love it. I love music of all genres, from rock to hip hop to country, and this just hits on every mark. This is a brilliant album, and a brilliant artist.', 'Like finding buried treasure... Like any treasure, must be heard to be appreciated. Stop reading this review right now and buy it and listen to it as I am: songs you know by heart and thought you knew and that you hear again as if the first time, at once familiar and foreign. Best part: Bob forgetting the opening to \"I Don\\'t Believe You\" and having the audience feed him the line.Just amazing stuff from someone who continues to amaze, even DATE.So enough! I\\'ll leave the philosophizing and preaching to others. I\\'m going back to listen to the CD; I can\\'t get enough of it!', 'Unexpected triumph. I grabbed this album when it was released in DATE and have never grown tired of it. I recently bought the CD, since my cassette tape has long since worn thin. I was drawn to the album by \"Gentlemen Who Fell,\" which received enough airplay to capture my attentinon. I was pleasantly surprised, though, with the rest of the work. \"In a Glade\" became one of my favorites. Since her music is unique, I can only describe the work as a thoughtful, sometimes dark, but lyrically sound and musically engaging piece of art. As one of my favorite albums, I can\\'t say anything negative about this album. Not a mainstream work to appeal to the masses, it is an excellent collection. No regrets, only pleasant surprises. Definitely worth a listen.', 'A really good cd i\\'m going to have to go with the other reviews and say that this is an awesome cd, but but should not be your first They cd. The songs take some getting used to, but there are some real treasures - \"Hey, Mr. DJ\", \"Don\\'t Let\\'s Start\", and the wonderful Untitled Track NUM - for those of you who are not familiar with this, it is an actual recording from when you could leave a message at Dial-A-Song (NUM-NUM-NUM just a call to local brooklyn!), and a woman named Gloria didn\\'t realize her conference call was being recorded....anyway, if you like They, then get this cd. If not, get another one or two (i\\'d recommend Flood for a first one, or maybe Apollo NUM), then buy it!', 'Stellar! Five stars is just enough to describe this CD. If the word \"stellar\" is not enough, I would add \"uncompromising.\" Every track on the CD is a high-quality new experience you will be eager to repeat. You might find yourself completely addicted! I have not stopped listening to this one for DATE, and my changer usually has high turnaround.If it were necessary to pigeonhole the disc, the most likely fit is \"alternative power ballad,\" but expect more creative range and catchiness than that label would allow. What a strong voice my man Waymon has! When the group did a live spot for Atlanta\\'s radio station 99X, he had to stand back from the mic to prevent feedback. This is not overproduced alternative; it is genuine rock quality.', 'A Great CD!! I just brouth the cd DATE and i have played it non-stop since i got it. I heard of NFG before i got the cd but i never really heard anything from them. I had burned a cd with one of the songs from this album for one of my friends and i really liked the song so i decided to get the cd if i ever found it. Sowhen i found it i was thinking if i should get this CD or another one that was in my hand. I decided this CD and im damn sure happy i did. I think all the songs are great nd id say Hit or Miss and Boy Crazy are my favorite songs on the CD. Since i got it though i have not stoped playing it and i enjoy playing it cause when i am under the weather this is a godd CD to listen to to bring me back up so i say anyone should get this cd no matter hwat you listen to cause i myself love hardrock more than anything but this would have to be on top of my list of cds.', \"Simply Magnifficent What can I say?I wish I could give this ten stars.(...)Edie Brickell is my favourite female vocalist of all and I absolutely adore the youthful and sensual beauty of her angelic voiceNot only this the lyrics are very good .Edie ,who writes the lyrics, has a great turn of phrase , 'philosophy is a walk on the slippery rocksreligion is alight in the fog'and 'There's nothing I hate more than nothingNothing keeps me up at nightI toss and turn over nothingNothing can cause a great big fight'And DATE album is by far the best of Edie Brickell and The New BohemiansApart from 'the well known and wonderful 'What I Am' and 'Circle ' there are also other beautiful melodies like 'Little Miss S' , 'Air of DATE' ,'The Wheel' ,Love Like We Do' ,'Circle' ,Beat the Tune' and 'Nothing' I could listen for TIME and still want more.if you like good music I cannot recommend this one enough\", \"Why you have to love this record! Many of us G.L.J. fans wondered whatever became of Gene Loves J, after the fantastic early records Promise and Immigrant, they seemed to drift into a so-so sea of pop mediocrity, What became of the passion and originality of DATE, it's so apparent now! Love Lies Bleeding was clear a signal enough to what was missing all these years and Giving Up The Ghost is dna evidence of the genius lost. This is a remarkable document. So diverse and original and just magnificent. There are so many avenues explored, it's Pollack and Picasso too and poetic and street wise, it rOCKS!!! DATE the world will discover this Artist and I pray sooner than later because Michael deserves recognition above all who walk this landscape. Touching, passionate, tender and witty.

The movies strongest attributes are its exceptional cast and moving story. Everyone is perfectly cast and there isn't an actor I would change. The brightest of all these bright stars are Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Toro (who won best supporting actor), and Don Cheadle. The story is told like Nashville and Magnolia. There are several mini stories that intertwine. I also loved the different colored lenses for each story. The DVD has superb picture and sound quality. If you're one of those people that likes a truck load of extras though, I suggest you wait for a special edition to be released. If not run to your local movie store and pick this baby up!\"]",

I actually had to return the item because the first one I received was defective (called Lowrance tech support and verified that in a matter of TIME when couldn't aquire any satelites), but Amazon made that process painless by shipping out a new one the day I called them about it and sending me a prepaid return label to return the defective one. I received my new item in DATE and it works great!! A lot of the other reviews mention problems with signal, but I live in the BOOOONNNIIEESS and have never lost signal once it is aquired (which never takes over two TIME or so). Even on DATE, this unit stays locked. I even sat it in the floorboard of the truck to see what would happen and it stayed locked.

Great little unit.\", \"Sound Quality good, Price Great I bought NUM sets these to listen to music downloaded from archive.org and ripped MP3's on my Sansa Fuze. My wife uses them while working on and listening to music on her iPhone 3GS. I keep them at work, in the car for skiing or walks in the park, at home for working in the yard or riding a bike. I also have a one for the computer and listening to youtube of live concerts in HD. Durable design that I have been using for DATE. It is nice to have good quality sound that allows you to hear what is going on around you, or turn them up to hear crisp bass and clear highs. Having a convenient pair of headphones where you need them is better than than having a more expensive headphone worrying about them being stolen or broken during transport/storage.I may not have needed to buy so many, all are still working well with good sound quality and cords and ear foam that is still comfortable to wear.\", \"It's perfect! We used this product during our entire trip to Ohio (TIME). Worked great. We had both the computer and the DVD player plugged in. Kept both me and our son happy. As for being loud - I have to disagree. We couldn't even hear it over the radio.

I went on and bought a Phillips because they were couple hundred dollars cheaper. Now that it was affordable we bought the tv and couldn't be happier.

I have seen some people complain that there is no on/off switch but it doesn't really matter. There is no real need to turn it off. This thing at the worst is gonna cost you about $.NUM a month if left on at all times.

         "['Sad to see all of these one-star ratings I think that the majority of these negative reviews come from readers who can\\'t appreciate a novel from a truly artistic point of view. The characters (especially Billy, who had a very limited voice) were very well developed, and the plot was well thought out. Many negative reviews focused on the \"lack of action.\" Does a novel need to be action packed to be good? If you think so, then stick to your MTV culture. CB is full of wonderful detail and exquisite storytelling. This novel deals with many issues that affect nearly all of us and should be read carefully. As far as those who criticize having to re-read passages, do you really want a book that doesn\\'t make you stop to think once in a while? Definately worthwhile, and deserving of a second reading by those who felt it \\'boring.\\'', \"I Liked This Intro to an Amazing Life It is sad that the errors that were noted by the other reviewers have marred the book. I did not know they were there and so what I got from this book was this fantastically gifted man and the passions of his life. This compact life is really full of drama. The monologues, debated in other comments, are based on the things Kelly expressed in other ways, as I understand it, but they weren't necessary. I was not bothered by the concise description of DATE of fizzles and disappointments in Kelly's later life. I can recommend this book as a very enjoyable read, and quite good for young readers, but it seems clear a big, fat, long, unimpeachably correct bio would make a lot of other people happy.\", 'slow start, good finish I bought the book based on the good reviews. After about a fourth of the book I was quite bored with it and went online to see if it was worth continuing. It seemed so. After the long, long part about the depression ends, the book becomes a real page-turner with some great insights into English and America culture. Very hard to put down and a very satisfying read!', \"Two Books in One I really enjoyed most of book... but it had an awkward pace.. Parts of it like the visit to Libby Hatches mothers house had me on edge. Other parts, like over descriptive dinner scenes were annoying. The end was disappointing. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it.. but a space ship could have landed to save DATE out of nowhere and had the same effect. I wish the ending had stayed with the story. The characters were great and saved the book, especially El Nino.\", 'Very readable Essentially there is nothing wrong with this book - in fact it is very compelling and readable and as such deserves a NUM star rating.Still in saying that I wonder what made Colleen write about such a religious event but duplicated in the future? It is not offensive in my mind but others who take the Christian religion seriously may see this book as blasphemy.Others like me who are not so worried will find this an easy and entertaining read that will leave you feeling a trifle sad about the world she has created in this novel.', \"Thoughtful book Like another reviewer, I agree that this is NOT the definitive treatise on the problems of the working poor but it takes a slice of the situation and analyzes it very well.We live well at the expense of others.That is a sobering thought. Moreover (though Ehrenreich doesn't go there at all) we do it not only at the expense of our fellow Americans but also global family members as well.On DATE when I had more time, it would be entertaining to read all of the one-star reviewers. Those reviewers will tell you more about themselves than the book. (I want to simultaneously apologize for that grossly biased remark, but many of those folks were unwilling to minutely face the costs attached to their life style and who pays).A thoughtful but quick read.\", 'Too Much Talk for My Tastes There\\'s lot of amusing insights into relationships here, combined with visuals by a very gifted artist.Unfortunately, the relationships ring hollow to me -- I just don\\'t believe in Anne, Ricky, and what\\'s-her-name as real people. They seem designed mainly for humour.The early part of the book is non-stop talking heads with little or no plot or action. The early chapters could be interchanged without much problem. The visuals liven up the succession of heads, but I found the artwork a little too lively; with shots from every angle, and expressions jumping from joy to angst in rapid succession.The latter half of the book livens up with Anne\\'s trip to LA and San Francisco. There was some action, and events that I could believe in.The road-trip elements at the end of the book might suggest \"Thelma and Louise\", but I believe this book was first published before the movie (?).', \"A good book that will rankle the close-minded This book is not perfect. For example, it seemes to me that Wills misunderstands Thoreau's use of irony, and I'm not sure the causal link between Reagan and abortion clinic bombings is as strong as Wills suggests. But most of the customers who have reviewed this book either NUM) haven't really read all the book or NUM) are hopelessly close minded.That said, I'll just add that Wills's latest book is a masterful analysis of the very fiber of American society. I don't know anyone who LOVES the government, but Wills shows why it is essential to our well-being, how it is a vital force in making this great country what it is. Few people know more about the Constitution than Wills, but he is not (as some readers suggest) a mere liberal pedant. Sometimes the truth hurts.\", 'A good read- but not if you\\'re looking for action. I\\'ll admit it. I HATED Hemingway after the mandatory \"Old Man and the Sea\" in high school, but when I saw this book, I had to give it a try, even if Hemingway was the author and I wasn\\'t dissapointed. It isn\\'t a plot filled with action or intrigue, but it is complex and fascinating in how it describes the personal relaitonships of the impotent protagonist Jake, his less than innocent love Brett, and the annoying tag-along Robert Cohn along with a slew of others that reminds me so much of the high school \"in crowd\" I started casting the characters with people I knew. It isn\\'t a book for everybody, in fact, unless you like working to understand meaning in a book this isn\\'t the one for you. However if you\\'re looking for more than a casual read you won\\'t be dissapointed. This is one of his very best.', 'Not bad, but wish for more... Some of the earlier chapter\\'s were well written and very intriguing, such as \"What if Jesus Had Lived?\" and \"China\\'s exploration carried further\". However some of it wasn\\'t all to interesting such as \"What if Hitler had lived?\", to sum it up as the book says, it wouldn\\'t matter, bleah! It is still worth it if you liked the first book that they did. However if you\\'re not much of an alternative history nut to begin with, don\\'t bother.']",

Still, the combination of activities, minimal noises, and no batteries (for once!) made it a parental favorite for us. In DATE and age of bells and whistles, it is refreshingly simple.The only thing we don't like about it is that it falls down very easily.

My hair is medium-fine, straight and on the oily side, and normally I avoid \"hydrating\" shampoos as they tend to make my hair limp and greasy looking. This shampoo contains glycerin (my favorite moisturizing ingredient in hand lotions as well) which makes my hair shiny and easier to style. I find if I switch to another shampoo that my hair gets a bit straw-like, comparatively. The feature that originally got me to buy this shampoo from my salon was the fabulous scent.

However, after applying this for DATE my chronic ingrowns disappeared (leaving an inch long hair coming out) and didn't come back (or if i did get another big one, it only lasted for DATE). I've also started using an exfoliating brush, one that is very stiff and you use when dry. That, combined with princereigns has gotten my skin back close to normal.

My face looks softer, pores are smaller and it removes whatever make-up my facial Cetaphil cleanser did not remove, prepping my skin for my night moisturizer. Now all I need is a cheaper night moisturizer not because I can not afford it, I just think that high end cosmetic companies are abusing a woman's need to look good.

         "['Best \"#@&%;!\" Game Ever !! I have to say, I\\'ve never laughed harder at any game I have ever played in my life.It,s pure genius, the violence, the vulgarity, the profanity.... I loved TIME of it. The different movie spoofs throughout the game made it hard to stop once you start, wondering what was comming next.I also enjoyed the various gameplay and different themes , and it was not hard to play, but not easy either , it was just right. I guess what I\\'m tryin to say is I see nothing wrong with this game, it\\'s one of the best games I have ever played ever. I even liked the horrible ending, it was the perfect ending to the perfect twisted, sick game. Buy it, you\\'ll like it. trust me.', \"Justice for All !! At the begining I was dissapointed by the characters detail (Dead or Alive NUM, Soul Calibur and even Virtua Fighter NUM are waaaaay superior), but THE GAMEPLAY IS AWESOME, now I don't even care about the character detail anymore. This fighter is lots of fun once you learn to handle how to punch, kick and jump (forget the classic Defense-Punch-Kick system). The party attacks and the group attacks are the sweetest thing in this game and are very easy to perform, and when you K.O. your opponent with one of those attacks you'll feel very good! This game is a little hard to master and the default settings are a little too high, but it can be adjusted. Tons of extras, hidden characters, great effects, great music... and a very low price! I usually dislike the Capcom games, but I really love this one. DATE I received Crazy Taxi NUM, but after TIME I went back to Project Justice (don't get me wrong CT2 is Awesome too!). A must have for a true 3D fighter lover.\", \"Great!!!! This game is the best game I have ever had! Don't worry about the Teen rating. Its very fun. The only problem is, you can't pick what dog you can be. When the game starts, you just end up controling that Jake dog. The other thing that I'm annoyed at, is that my DATE sister wants to play badly. Why can't this game be for NUM players so that I can verse my sister at mini games?! Howerver, the game is still is very fun.\", \"Warning Warning:some people complain you don't playh much at the beginning, well thats somewhat true, but if you do not watch what happens, then the game will be so much worse. Also, be sure to buy this when you don't have anything to do in DATE, because beware: this game is the most addicting game out on the market, i played this for DATE for TIME a day, and i still play it now, DATE after i bought it, please buy this game if you want to play the very best of ps2 games, this sold way more than GTA3 and MGS2, as hard as it seems it is true, it sold like NUM million copies in japan in DATE! buy this game, any videogame website will rate this at least a NUM, its that good. do yourself a favor and go get it now!\", 'Extraordinary game This game is probably the best I\\'ve ever played, and perhaps the best game I will ever play. It has all of the features you could want in a turn based game.The automation of funtions is incredible. Based on your wishes, you can designate tasks for units to perform, instead of dealing with the monotony of reissuing the same command turn after turn. For example, you can just say tell a unit to \"build road\", and it will only build roads... and will do so in places that make sense. Truly amazing AI...Add to that the rich cultures and philosophies of the characters, ability to customize units any way you\\'d like, great sci-fi, and you\\'re left with a game that is still a force to be contented with DATE after its release.However, because of the wide range of possibilities, the game can be quite complex.If you\\'re not intimidated by having to think, this game is definitely for you. I look forward to a sequel, should they ever develop one.', 'this game is for and one who used there brain more than once this could be so much fun for you if your realy cant get a date but its just a game so do get to happy lol so if you like rpg and like the long crud games that some people dont get go for it i cant say much but its great and the pics are cool but it realy for DATE older if u ask me', \"if you want to be happy, BUY THIS GAME! This game never gets old and is actually one of the few games that I had a hard time with. It took me over DATE to beat it. It's the best game of all, and still is\", 'This game is fun I personaly liked this game. some levels were hard but eventially you will pass them. the cool part is that you can be on the darkside on some bonus levels. the graphics are good and you can use cooler ships than the nintendo NUM game. if you really want some cooler ships like the slave NUM put in a code. you will like this game if you buy it.', 'wow I have to admit this is a great game.although people say the game has poorly drawn images(i toldy disagree on)it is an exciting and fun game.It relies on stategy and your knowledge over the units.You get to use land,sea,and air units.I would sugest that people buy this game.', \"pretty good game I borrowed Buck Bumble from a friend awhile back and I thought it was a pretty good game. The only things I didn't like about it were that after you get past mission NUM, it gets too hard and every time you get killed, you have to start all the way over in that level. It's fun flying and killing the enemies and the boss levels are a lot of fun, but Buck has to be the slowest walker ever made when you try combat from the ground. The insects and graphics are done pretty well, but they could be a little bit better. The sound is probably the best attribute to the game other than the fun factor.To keep it from getting too boring, there's a NUM player soccer game that makes this game a lot better. If you want a challenging shooting/adventure game, this could be a good game to get.\"]",

So why the pain? Because, in order to get the Lost Disc, you have to purchase the entire thing all over again, which is an unnecessary expense to the many who already have the NUM-Disc Collectors Edition. I'm not sure if the good folks at Buena Vista considered how this will result in many of the original NUM-Discers ending up in a lot of Used DVD bins. Normally, that would be fine, but the people who are going to want the NUM-Discer (as opposed to the Single Disc, Just-The-Movie edition) are going to be the obsessive extras collectors who will therefore want the Lost Disc.The Lost Disc extras are great, but would it not have been at least a bit more convenient to put out the Lost Disc as a single component?\", \"Great Film, DVD bonus lacking... Film: Bonuses: Amazing chapter in the evangelion rebuild, a must see and must own for any Eva fan.Unfortunately like many anime companies they still don't know how to make a dvd with decent extras. All you get are some production screens, some production vids where they show you a scene's evolution from concept to final(sounds good on paper but was in dull in execution)It would have been nice to have vignettes with the cast and crew about the behind the scenes making of the film... the commentary was mildly amusing at least.This isn't bashing the film, it is top notch providing new experiences and intrigue for Eva fans for the first time in DATE I highly recommend, and I was very happy with my purchase, its just sad that the bonus features didn't match the quality of the film itself is all I only criticize in hopes that it helps anyone better understand this aspect of their purchase...\", \"Poor quality, great series! So I bought this item trying to avoid the customer reviews of 'poor quality of disks.'As I started watching, when I was in second season the episodes began to freeze, i was playing the disks on my DVD Player, however, everything looked just fine when I started watching on my Blu Ray Player.I love the package! It's beautiful. So I highly recommend it, just be sure to play the disks con your Blu Ray!\", \"alternate version is by far the best version. I saw this at the cinema and while I enjoyed it annoyed me a little because certain elements of the story didn't add up. However the alternate version which has a different third act clears those up, in fact it is very different. In fact I find it amazing that this was not the version shown at the cinema.The features are all interesting enough and the picture quality is very good too. A worthwhile ourchase on blu ray.\", 'Worth every penny...almost The extended version of the film is fantastic for fans of the theatrical release. It fleshes out the characters and scenes and is every bit as enjoyable as the first. However, people should be warned against buying the gift set as opposed to the plain DVD. After being duped into buying the theatrical release with practically no bonus material DATE, I was determined not to make that mistake again. However, what I didn\\'t realize that the only difference between the gift set and the regular DVD is the Argonath statuettes and the National Geographic DVD \"Beyond the Movie\", which may be a fabulous disc, but hardly worth more than twice the price. Buy the special edition, it is a must-own, but don\\'t waste your money on the \"gift set\", it is only a gift to the studio, just like the first DVD release.', 'A Much Needed Update The stale and lifeless special effects of the DATE\\'s may have dazzled fans then but DATE they would fall flat on a more expereinced audience. In DATE CGI, would you accept a puppet espousing universal wisdom or wooden and stiff sword fighting? Of course not.George Lucas delivers to the fans, old and young, new and veteran, freshly polished and retuned trilogies. The new krayt dragon call is clearer and more chilling despite the scoffs of so called \"fans.\" The scene of Vader defeating the Emperor has been improved and now linked to the end of the \"Revenge of the Sith\" almost like the meter of an epic poem.Improved audio and increased clarity with vibrant colors are to be expected with a Blu-Ray release. What makes this a \"must buy\" is this is a re-telling of an already masterful story.A star off because of the packaging. It\\'s too filmsy and I have to imagine a future released will have something more sturdy.', 'Movie is a classic, blu ray treatment of it doesn\\'t add much I have always loved John Wayne movies,and considered \"The Searchers\" to be one of the best. My opinion of that remains unchanged, however, I didn\\'t see much different between the standard DVD version and the blu ray version of this movie. My TV, TV cables, and blu ray player are all top of the line and I have watched other blu ray discs on it and have been wowed by the detail and clarity. This movie didn\\'t really offer much more then the standard DVD version. It\\'s only priced a few more dollars above the standard DVD so its not that much of a risk and if you want the newest version of this movie, you will have it, but if you want to save a few bucks and get the same quality picture just go with the Standard DVD version. I don\\'t think this is anyone\\'s fault, I just think that the movie technology of the DATE\\'s doesn\\'t convert well to Blu ray, but thats just one guys opinion. Either way the movie is excellent.', 'Good, but not perfect I was thrilled to finally be purchasing one of my favorite \"musicals\" of all times, especially at the thought of enjoying The Wall in Dolby Digital NUM surround-sound. While the musics tracks of the DVD were awesome, as well as some of the special effects (explosions, etc.), the dialogue was poorly mixed in with the soundtrack requiring me to constantly adjust the volume (quite annoying).The picture was clear enough, and altogether it was a good experience. Any die-hard fan of The Wall will truly appreciate the enhancements of Dolby Digital as well as the sharp digital picture. I highly recommend it - just be ready with the remote for those volume adjustments.', \"biollante blu ray i bought both dvd and blu ray of this movie, been waiting forever for this. the blu ray picture is good, considering its a DATE movie, and its a godzilla movie, it does say DATE on the box, maybe the original films/transfers were not as good? though imo the destroy all monsters blu ray might have had a better picture. the english dub is low mono. i had to turn up my surround sound way up to hear it. but i did switch between english and japanese to see if it was the disk itself. and it is only the english version that is low, the japanese sounds amazing. the movie is in widescreen and my dvd does say widescreen on it too. being this was only NUM for blu ray and NUM for dvd i can't really complain. they did a great job with this release and i'm happy to finally own it on blu ray/dvd. godzilla fans will love this, and we can finally retire our old vhs tapes.\"]",

         "[\"Aerobics section is great The aerobics section of this video is beginner/intermediate level and great! It's fun and Karen is an excellent instructor. I also like that it's short. If you are an advanced exerciser, use this on your easy DATE or try something more difficult. Perfect for the average exerciser. Unique set makes it more interesting to look at than some other videos. I've had the video forever and still enjoy getting it out, although the bar section (I even bought the bar) never thrilled me.\", \"Best Dance DVD - You will lose weight I was looking for something to spark my routine. I found a clip on youtube and liked what I saw. Checked out the price on Amazon and took a chance..the best [...] bucks I ever spent. You will sweat you butt off, I couldn't do all the routines but by my 4th workout I was improving. In DATE; NUM sessions I lost NUM IBS. I could not believe it. No DVD workout has did that before and trust me I have all of them. You actually have fun with this DVD, by the time you realize it you have done TIME. There isn't alot of teaching here so just follow along. I reminded me of the latin parties growing up in NYC. I loved the music and the lil gal is so energetic, she makes you want to go the extra mile. Try it, it is a nice break from circuit training.Loved it.\", \"It's a great old-fashioned high-impact aerobic workout I've used this workout at home for DATE an it's the best high-impact aerobic workout I've found--and I've tried a few! The music isn't as cheezy as most of them, and I think it's quite inspirational now. This workout starts out slowly, and then it picks up. What I like about it is if I don't feel up to it, I can keep my feet on the floor (not jump if I don't want to) and still feel like I had a good workout. I usually only do the aerobic portion which is only NUM mins, but there's also a toning portion targeting all those fun areas. This workout is definitly in my rotation of workouts.\", \"An oldie but a goodie I've had this dvd for DATE and its one I keep coming back to. If it had some exercises for chest and back it would be perfect. (Which is why it only gets NUM, instead of NUM stars from me). As it is, a great workout that you can mix and match to make it as tough as you want. The exercises are solid and Tamilee really knows her stuff. Definitely a classic you should have in your exercise library.\", \"Great Mix I always enjoy the workouts that Prevention puts together - there's so much variety that you will certainly not get bored. Your heartrate will be up, but I was never gasping for breath (which is good!) Chris definitely has a cheerful personality that isn't overwhelming. She's encoraging, motivating, and makes you hit all the areas of your body. If your looking something that really intense, this video isn't it, but I still feel it's a decent workout. And it's broken up into seperate segments, so if you are crunched for time you can just do what your in the mood for.\", \"LOVE IT! Great mix of cardio and weights. I really feel it when I'm done with this work out. She does move through the workout fast but once you get teh steps down you'll really appreciate the fast pace. I would highly recommend this workout video.\", 'Excellent conditioning This is a great workout DVD for strength and dance conditioning; it is quite a challenge the first few times,and left me sore for DATE - which, in a workout, is a desirable outcome. I highly recommend it.', \"Amazing I've done a lot of workout DVDs and Jillian Michaels' are by far my favorites. I don't need to lose a lot, maybe another NUM-NUM lbs, but really wanted to tone up. I started with her DATE Shred and just received her No More Trouble Zones, which I did for the first time DATE. OMG! I have NEVER felt the effects of a workout like this, and I LOVE it. My obliques are even sore, which is so reassuring that I've actually worked them! I was dripping sweat by the end. I can't wait to do it again!! And I am excited to see how I'll look and feel in DATE. HELLO SUMMER!\", 'best fitness DVD i have, the best the options in this prenatal DVD are superb, it is simply the best prenatal video ever made. I love the way Leisa Hart teaches and i absolutely love the aerobics and yoga style toning. The tips section was very valuable, especially coming from someone who looks so good but is not a workout junky. I have seen and read about Leisa Hart and I absolutely loved this DVD, the music option is great and the extra photo gallery was a joy to view, it must have been a blast filming this workout tape, everyone seemed to be having a lot of un. I have bought several as gifts for friends in my Moms Club and also am getting several for church moms who need a lift of motivation during their pregnancies. I suggest this to anyone I talk to about staying fit. As a personal trainer, I need tips from good role models, and Leisa Hart is definitely mine, as she looks goods, sound good, and puts a great product together. This was a great buy adn I am glad I discovered it at Amazon.', \"Pretty Hardcore for TIME I bought this DVD because even though I work out every day for a little over an hour, it was more like zoning-out. That having been said, even for a more Intermediate-Advanced exerciser like myself, it is VERY high impact. If you're nursing some injuries, even old ones, this may not be for you. I know that after jumping up-and-down for TIME straight my ancient hip injury started to bother me again. Truthfully, I will probably only do this workout when I don't have time for a trip to the gym. But I find her encouraging remarks and approach to exercise useful and will apply it to my regular workout.\"]",

I have listened to this off and on for DATE, waiting for most of the songs to catch on, and what I have found is that most of the cuts are to \\'noise orientated\\' and sloppy. Songs that are plain awful are \\'Bomb\\', \\'Testosterone\\', \\'Monkey\\', and \\'Alien\\'. To much \"whining\" from the lead singer and not a mealody to be found from the guitarist ! I call this a dirty trick, figuring that this is the same group that came up with excellent songs such as \\'Everything Zen\\' and \\'Comedown\\'. These songs show so much craftsmanship that I would expect the same from all (or most) of the songs. It just doesn\\'t happen ! Figuring \\'Razorblade Suitcase\\' and \\'Deconstructed\\' are failures for this band - I think we will be seeing them in DATE on VH1\\'s WHERE ARE THEY NOW segments.', 'not worth the star i gave it Well boys and girls the next time you look up the word mistake you will see a picture of me holding this CD. What a waste of hard earned cash!!! this CD was such bore with what seemed to be a complete lack of imagination, not only on the part of Tenaglia but, on the part of the producers too. It seems like in todays Music industry creativity is a Bad word. SOOOooo incredibly boring... When I bought it I thought I was gonna get some smooth tunes maybe something to relax to but, NO!!! instead what I got was the worst display of.... \"I sold out and, now that my name can sell CD\\'s who cares what I sell\" .....For those who like this CD I recomend a check up at your nearest Physicians A.S.A.P you might have Mono good luck but get a difrent CD', \"Very disappointing to me I am a very, very big Elliott Smith fan and have been for DATE, the kind who has every recording, live, bootleg, videos of him playing, saw him live, read his biography, etc. I am selling my copy of this album without even ripping it because there isn't a single song on it that does anything new with the music or is in any way better than the originals. In short, they all suck. Waste of time, waste of money. But hey, maybe it's just me.....\", \"I wish there was the zero star option This album does not even deserve the praise of one mesely star. The music was just some computer recreation of Britney's songs. I thought the days of synthesizing music was over, apparently not! I can't believe people buy this garbage, they don't play instruments, I don't even know if there is a band. The lyrics are laughable (not that they even write them) and their voices are poor at best. To call these guy musicians or even artists should offend anyone with a brain.

It sounded even worse in the live album, Bullet in the Bible.Geek Stink Breath is really the only other song on this album I liked.

This isnt a return to anything, just another.... attempt by the band to evolve into something more mainstream. This cd has no solid intro's, no good guitar solo's, and no good lyrics. Some people are saying the drums are really good on this album, but all it sounds like to me is a DATE banging on a pot with a spoon. Even the best song on the cd, St. Anger, is worse than anything they've ever produced before. Hetfield's voice is just horrible. I can't stand what they've turned into; a bunch of money grubbin' has beens. I own every cd they've ever made but I refuse to buy this one.

All I have to say is that I can't believe almost nobody notices that all the sons use the same chords, over and over again. The only reason I gave this CD an extra star its because some of the lyrics are good and were written with a good purpose, although expressed through a bad medium.

How can this possibly have so many good ratings I don't understand. The worst, and most boring , and the stupidest movie ever. And what did the stupid rabbit head scenes have to do with anything? For that matter what did any of the movie have to do with anything? It made absolutely NO sense.

I am a true B movie fan and am very used to terrible movies, but this one couldn\\'t even be enjoyed from a B perspective. I actaully shut this one off due to complete bordem which is something I never do. The best thing I can suggest for this dvd is that you use it as a frisbee to wing at someone.It was inspired by the true story of a NUM foot crocodile that was responsible for over NUM deaths. This inspires a crew of flunkies to go to Africa to find the man eating beast, but instead takes a turn towards the economic problems of the people. I wish in TIME the croc would have eaten the crew and gotten the movie over with. Orlando Jones starred in this mess in which I saw better acting from him in his old sprite commercials.This one definately doesn\\'t get my seal of approval.

I have no problems with the movie\\'s message; my problem is with its complete lack of originality. I cannot recall an original moment in this entire movie. What I can recall is gratuitous edginess and a mindless collection of plotlines and vignettes ripped from movies like Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, and the Professional. I understand that in watching a film like this one needs to suspend a measure of disbelief, but this film asks its viewers to be idiots. The dialogue is terrible and the scenarios the characters find themselves in are often moronic.

One look at the first CG'd monster and you'll laugh. I fast-forwarded through to see if there was any substance to the film, but it remained shallow throughout and at one point even repeated the entire opening scene in the middle of the movie.

However, upon reading it I was more disappointed than delighted. I felt like the author was trying too hard to be deep and profound. Often times the story would abruptly end and I would be left wondering if there was symbolic or poetic value in it ending where it did, or whether the author just got tired of writing and so ended the story. However, unwilling to leave this book without having given it every chance to redeem itself (or rather, the author, not the book) I read until the very end. I suppose I found in the last story \"Parker Swells\" some remnants of a decent story and so the book is the better for this story.

I won't deny Mitchell's undeniable talent as a critically acclaimed and esteemed author, it's just this book......One of the reviews I read on this site was from someone who had read it and wanted to claim their life back for TIME wasted on reading it. I share this sentiment, having chosen it as the only fiction to bring on my Spanish holiday. Sadly, I feel completely ripped off, conned even.

In a scene where the main character has her first meeting with the vampires, the narrative gets so wrapped up in her talking about the past that I could barely follow what was going on. At a pivotal scene such as this, I expected much better writing. Since the author failed to deliver, I felt it not worth my time or effort to keep on reading. Getting even this far in the book was a struggle and a chore for me. I was bored and did not feel any interest for the main character and her obsession with baking. The other characters felt like filler, and the world as a whole was difficult to visualize.', 'Confusing, disjointed.....i could not finish it! i would like to know how anyone finished this book.

The King quote and the favorable reviews had me anxious to read this, but the story just doesn't pan out. The evil starts to manifest itself with aberrant sexual behavior and torture, and then...just does the same thing over and over again. It's a one trick pony. And the characters, oy! Gifford Stevens, the professor of comparative literature and high explosives (!), is nothing but a cypher, a plot device, and the others don't fare much better. Key plot points happen off-screen, mainly because Little either couldn't explain them logically or didn't want to take the time. And the little epilogue at the end, and the heroes' reaction to it, was especially annoying.

I'm usually really good at knowing too what I'll like, but sadly from the beginning this book was an epic failure. The character's were hard to follow because there were so many and so much bouncing around. I didn't connect with any of them on an intimate level. There were times that I would have to back track because I got so bored reading that I paid no attention to what I read. There were grammar errors throughout the book and it was so cheezy that I was at times embarrassed I was reading it.I'm halfway through the book now and will not be finishing it. It's a complete waste of space in my brain that could be filled with much more entertaining fiction. Do yourself a favor and don't listen to the good reviews unless you are NUM or under because you will be thoroughly disappointed.\", \"What a waste--don't bother This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It was the most corny and predictable plot I have encountered since middle school. I had never read Patterson before, but having heard such great things and seeing that he is always on the best sellers list, I decided to give this a try. What a complete waste of time. I thought it stunk a few chapters in. but continued because I thought it would get better. It never did, and in fact, it got worse and more unrealistic as the plot went on. The latter parts of the book are cheesier than a soap opera. I don't want to give anything away in case someone out there is crazy enough to want to waste their life away, but the ending is absolutely ridiculous. Please don't buy this book.

I never played any of the other Street Fighter games so I did not know what to expect. If you like Street Fighter games, then I guess all these other positive reviews are the ones to go by. If not, then I say skip this game. I would suggest renting it before owning it, but even that would be a waste of too much money.

So, i rented it. I am sorry to say it's just as bad, and actually worse. I couldn't even get through TIME of it. The graphics are poor even for a ps2, the sound is awful, the commentary ... and the controls are atrocious. The ski jumping is awful and the bobsled is just as bad. You get never sensation of speed or any sensation at all, really. The gameplay feels really dead. There's no life to any of it.

         "['NOT a good workout! I am a belly dancer and I thought I might like this DVD because Hula is SO similar! I was looking forward to it but was very disappointed.DETAILS:I DID NOT like this \"workout\" at all. The first NUM minutes are fine - not bad at all. After that it becomes mundane and VERY BORING. It is VERY slow moving and yet . . . there is NOT ENOUGH CUEING.Since this is targeted to beginners the instructor should have BROKEN DOWN THE MOVES to make them understandable and more doable. She DOES NOT do this.MY SYNOPSIS:Beginners WILL get LOST and the more advanced will be BORED.This DVD did not hold my attention and was NOT it a good work out. I\\'m sorry. I have to say thumbs down! God bless.', 'not a workout!!! I didnt have high expextations when I ordered this tape - I know from ecperience that NUM-NUM-NUM minute classes on the same tape might mean you have to run the tape in the middle of the exsersize or too match cool down/worm up or not enough. But having many of Janes workouts that work for me so well I desided to go for it, because I need more tapes for the time I am in harry fro work and I only have TIME.I was so dissappointed! this is not a workout at all - just a seies of dances (very good I admit and fun to do) - no worm up, no cool down, there is a note of TIME end but no streches or anything, there is no note that TIME ended - finally after TIME I had to go so I did my own quick cool down and stopped the tape ..Buy this tape ony if you need aerobic part for another workout and you dont mind switching the tapes all the time.', \"Couldn't even watch it! I can't really comment on the dvd's content--I only watched TIME. So let me tell you why I threw the dvd in the trash after barely even watching it. The lady's thick New York accent was a really annoying turn off. Plus she is old(and I don't mean to be rude by saying that). I prefer to work out with an instructor my age with a charasmatic personality and a body that I wish I had. I sooo did not get my needs met with this lame dvd. Unless you're old and/or deaf, don't waste your money! Try Crunch Total Resculpt or any of the Karen Voight dvds instead.\", \"Don't get this unless you just love Kim This was a complete impulse buy for me, one I regretted as soon as I tried the workout. If you are anything other than a beginner, there is no challenge here. Kim keeps saying how hard everything is and acts as if working out is a burden to her. There is a lot of chatter. One positive is an interesting set. Other than that, there are so many good videos out there and this is not one of them! Don't waste your money, you will be disappointed. Also the emphasis in this workout isn't even the abs; therefore the video's title is a misnomer.\", 'disappointing for intermediate-level yoga fan I thought that this would be a fast-paced and strenuous workout, but it is far too slow. Also, the instructor never stopped talking, which I found extremely distracting and annoying. I think this would be a better workout for novices, who need instruction on form and more time to get into the feel of a pose. I will try to find someone to give this DVD to; all I can say is that at least I only blew [a little cash] on this one.I far prefer my Power Yoga: The Complete Workout with Rodney Yee (flowing poses with minimal yakking)--although it is definitely for someone who is already familiar with basic yoga poses.', \"don't waste your time and money The book is so confusing and complicated. It will take me hours, maybe days, to read all the instructions for each move and learn the sequence. I have read many exercise books and this one is so awful. You really need the DVD for the Total Workout. The DVD costs $NUM on her website. So ridiculously expensive! Plus, I don't understand how her exercises could be aerobic by doing some knee/leg lifts at a moderate pace and strength training (bone-building) without lifting any weights. Please don't waste your time and money on this book.\", 'disappointed very disappointing. Most of the workout is just aerobic moves that have been used on everybody\\'s video for DATE. Not much to learn about Latino dancing. Also it seems the people in the video heard music they are not letting us hear because they seem to be having fun. There is a continuous drum beat but it\\'s not music. The second half does have a little music, but by then, I couldn\\'t stand one more beat on the drum.I whould rename this \"Just another aerobic workout with a drum beat added after the fact video\".', \"Not really a workout I am of average fitness and have done a few dancing classes - and I didn't find this to be much of a workout at all. I also found that Carmen doesn't always explain the moves properly and there is a lot of focus on her looking sexy but not a lot on teaching you the moves. I bought the discs separately but I really wish that I had purchased the box set because some of the discs' aren't worth it. It's fun to watch and it's not bad for you but not worth it if you are looking for an actual workout.\", \"So, so ANNOYING! This has got to be the most annoying workout video I have ever done! I thought Denise Autsin was bad. DATE is so annoying! She talks to her sister-in-law/trainer and thinks she is hilarious. She tries to crack jokes and thinks she is so funny. Her and her SIL's banter is just intolerable.If I do this video again, I will mute the volume and put some decent music on so I dont have to hear DATE.I am so disappointed I bought this. It gets NUM starts because it is a decent workout. It is really long and drawn out, especially the long versions...I would definitely recommend only doing the express workouts. Even with those, I found myself waiting around and sighing.I cant believe there arent more reviews of annoyed viewers!\", \"I don't get it Based on these glowing reviews, I was expecting a fantastic program. My first minor complaint is the voiceover narration. I can understand why yoga instructors choose this format, but I guess I'm partial to live instruction. Perhaps I would have found the voiceover narration more tolerable had this dvd been setup differently. A mix-n-match option sounds like a potentially great idea, but the routines on this dvd are choppy and repetitive. My biggest complaint is the constant use of props. I bought this dvd to relax and relieve stress. I did not buy this dvd to fold towels in thirds.. place pillows here and there.. etc...This is a hugely overrated title, in my opinion.\"]",
