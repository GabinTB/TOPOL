The first third is true to the form of A Sailor of Austria. An edifying slice of history told in a delightful fashion. Every page includes something fascinating about the Austro Hungarian empire as well as something laugh out loud funny. The other two thirds don't achieve the same level though.

So far, it seems to be doing quite well. I was a bit leary of the way the pump fits into the faountain (from the bottom, through a hole in the body of the bowl), but the O-ring seems to be doing its job and I've not detected any leaks yet. (That said, I'd have been more comfortable with a design where the pump inserted from the top, into a 100% sealed bowl-unit, as with the FreshFlow.)The filters for these units have not been bastardised (yet) as those for the FreshFlows have been; when it comes to my beloved pet I will not tolerate any cost-cutting tomfoolery with the design. The huge reservoir is a plus, as is the deep bowl. Be assured, if the thing starts to leak in future I will update this review accordingly; for now, 4 Stars.",

I dont really know what to label them, yet they seem to combine death and hardcore music (grindcore perhaps?) and put an interesting twist on things. Please dont listen to the reviewer that said that might sound somewhat like Hatebreed. Hatebreed is not a bad band, yet they are strictly modern hardcore, and Red Cord puts themself in another catorgory by sticking to a mostly \"Death/Grind\" Format. But to move on with the review, this is a really good album. It is a bit much to absorb at first as the combination of styles kinda plays with you, yet it seems to grow on you the more you listen. The Red Cord is a treat to extreme music, and hopefully they will continue to give us some great albums in the future. ENJOY",

I bought two sets at different times and neither set had any chips so the packaging for shipping was appropriate.3. They do seem to make things more moist when you soak them prior to using. I'm not sure you want this for ALL breads, but for pumpkin/banana that sort of thing it's awesome. I think you could not soak if you don't want the moisture.4. I haven't used them really often as I only bake for other people, not myself, but these are what I use now for any kind of recipe that I need a loaf pan for.5. I think they would be really cute to serve bread in at family parties.Quick review of instructions in case you've lost yours:Soak for 15 minutes in water prior to using. Start pans off in a COLD oven to gradually bring them to temp.**The first time I used these I forgot to do this and they didn't shatter, but it's probably not a good idea to take chances.",

You have to get a knife, and in the nut and saddle, thicken the wedges wear the strings go in, and make them deeper.Second, the standard tuning for a guitar is eadgbe. eadgbe on this size instrument will have to much slack with the strings because of the scale size. So there are to instruments that come similar to this. A guitalele made by yamaha(not sold in the U.S) and a requinto which is a mexican instrument that is also tuned to adgcea.

Readable not just for the historian, but the layman as well, the writing is superb. Snippets of information in side boxes offer amusing and informative anecdotes. One major strength of this work is that fact that the reader comes away with an idea of the Japanese perspective on the West, specifically the United States. Often either demonized or put on a pedestal by Westerners, this book provides insight into both the strengths and weaknesses of Japan as well as the West. The only drawback is that this book ends in the early 1990s, before the onset of deep recession in Japan. It would be of great value to get Dr. Boyle's perspective on the decade of the 90s and how the Japanese recession has affected Japan-US relations, as well as Japanese attitudes towards Japan itself.",

I saw this when it was broadcast on PBS. It presents a Soviet view of the war with all that entails but you really can't overdramatize what happened there.",

         "Sometimes Straight to DVD doesn't mean its ab bad movie I watched this movie because I had a free code for Redbox; I was scanning videos and I thought that this was a good premise for a movie. I agree with another reviewer that the ending was somehow less than what I expected, however, it also was one of those endings that leads the viewer to come to their own conclusion. You have nine people in a room and the truth is that they know each other, but they don't know how they know each other. On the surface, this is a suspenseful movie; underneath that, its a lesson about how the choices we make in life, affect the lives of others. Great movie!",

As any developing mystery series I expect the characters to expand as the series does. If you find out everything about a character at the beginning of the series what is there to discover later? Barbeque is big business and Lou Jane Temple does as many other authors do, sets the characters and story line in a place she knows.Again, I recommend this series to anyone who likes an enjoyable mystery and wants some yummy recipes to add to their menus.",

I think it stinks that you have to buy extra screens and rainguards for strollers when you will ovbiously need these items! Other than that this stroller has been a lifesaver. I recently brought home twin boys, and once my \"help\" left town after two weeks, it was great to be able to run the babies around the neigborhood.

         "The Bigs is both HARD and FUN Here's the deal:The Bigs can be very frustrating at first. Most of this frustration is caused by the manual being horrible at descirbing the required motions with the wiimote.However, once you figure out the controls, the game becomes quite fun. If anything, all you need is good coordination and a good memory to have fun (there are ALOT of different wiimote actions).After you get over the controls (it took me a day or two), you can concentrate on enjoying the game. Slow-motion leaps and dives, 30 foot superman-esque jumps off the wall to steal homers, etc. I've read complaints about the swing being delayed a bit compared to wii sports baseball. My answer? Deal with it! Anyone half good at video games will get used to it almost immediately. Some people just like to complain :).I've only had this game for a few days, and look forward to building up my rookie. So far I'm quite satisfied with my purchase.",

         "['One of the best albums of DATE Set aside copyright or CD issues. This is not the artists choice, this is a bigger problem with the whole record industry, and has nothing to do with a \"review\" about the music. I get the feeling some people have not actually taken the time and listened to this entire album before deciding to write some type of disgruntled review, which is ridiculous. This is one of those rare albums that each and every single song on there is absolutely amazing. The kind of CD you put in car and enjoy the ride, because each song makes you move and sing along. The kind of album you put in when friends are over and while they are moving to the beat they ask who it is because its like nothing they\\'ve heard before, but love it. I love music of all genres, from rock to hip hop to country, and this just hits on every mark. This is a brilliant album, and a brilliant artist.', 'Like finding buried treasure... Like any treasure, must be heard to be appreciated. Stop reading this review right now and buy it and listen to it as I am: songs you know by heart and thought you knew and that you hear again as if the first time, at once familiar and foreign. Best part: Bob forgetting the opening to \"I Don\\'t Believe You\" and having the audience feed him the line.Just amazing stuff from someone who continues to amaze, even DATE.So enough! I\\'ll leave the philosophizing and preaching to others. I\\'m going back to listen to the CD; I can\\'t get enough of it!', 'Unexpected triumph. I grabbed this album when it was released in DATE and have never grown tired of it. I recently bought the CD, since my cassette tape has long since worn thin. I was drawn to the album by \"Gentlemen Who Fell,\" which received enough airplay to capture my attentinon. I was pleasantly surprised, though, with the rest of the work. \"In a Glade\" became one of my favorites. Since her music is unique, I can only describe the work as a thoughtful, sometimes dark, but lyrically sound and musically engaging piece of art. As one of my favorite albums, I can\\'t say anything negative about this album. Not a mainstream work to appeal to the masses, it is an excellent collection. No regrets, only pleasant surprises. Definitely worth a listen.', 'A really good cd i\\'m going to have to go with the other reviews and say that this is an awesome cd, but but should not be your first They cd. The songs take some getting used to, but there are some real treasures - \"Hey, Mr. DJ\", \"Don\\'t Let\\'s Start\", and the wonderful Untitled Track NUM - for those of you who are not familiar with this, it is an actual recording from when you could leave a message at Dial-A-Song (NUM-NUM-NUM just a call to local brooklyn!), and a woman named Gloria didn\\'t realize her conference call was being recorded....anyway, if you like They, then get this cd. If not, get another one or two (i\\'d recommend Flood for a first one, or maybe Apollo NUM), then buy it!', 'A Great CD!! I just brouth the cd DATE and i have played it non-stop since i got it. I heard of NFG before i got the cd but i never really heard anything from them. I had burned a cd with one of the songs from this album for one of my friends and i really liked the song so i decided to get the cd if i ever found it. Sowhen i found it i was thinking if i should get this CD or another one that was in my hand. I decided this CD and im damn sure happy i did. I think all the songs are great nd id say Hit or Miss and Boy Crazy are my favorite songs on the CD. Since i got it though i have not stoped playing it and i enjoy playing it cause when i am under the weather this is a godd CD to listen to to bring me back up so i say anyone should get this cd no matter hwat you listen to cause i myself love hardrock more than anything but this would have to be on top of my list of cds.', 'Stellar! Five stars is just enough to describe this CD. If the word \"stellar\" is not enough, I would add \"uncompromising.\" Every track on the CD is a high-quality new experience you will be eager to repeat. You might find yourself completely addicted! I have not stopped listening to this one for DATE, and my changer usually has high turnaround.If it were necessary to pigeonhole the disc, the most likely fit is \"alternative power ballad,\" but expect more creative range and catchiness than that label would allow. What a strong voice my man Waymon has! When the group did a live spot for Atlanta\\'s radio station 99X, he had to stand back from the mic to prevent feedback. This is not overproduced alternative; it is genuine rock quality.', \"Simply Magnifficent What can I say?I wish I could give this ten stars.(...)Edie Brickell is my favourite female vocalist of all and I absolutely adore the youthful and sensual beauty of her angelic voiceNot only this the lyrics are very good .Edie ,who writes the lyrics, has a great turn of phrase , 'philosophy is a walk on the slippery rocksreligion is alight in the fog'and 'There's nothing I hate more than nothingNothing keeps me up at nightI toss and turn over nothingNothing can cause a great big fight'And DATE album is by far the best of Edie Brickell and The New BohemiansApart from 'the well known and wonderful 'What I Am' and 'Circle ' there are also other beautiful melodies like 'Little Miss S' , 'Air of DATE' ,'The Wheel' ,Love Like We Do' ,'Circle' ,Beat the Tune' and 'Nothing' I could listen for TIME and still want more.if you like good music I cannot recommend this one enough\", \"Why you have to love this record! Many of us G.L.J. fans wondered whatever became of Gene Loves J, after the fantastic early records Promise and Immigrant, they seemed to drift into a so-so sea of pop mediocrity, What became of the passion and originality of DATE, it's so apparent now! Love Lies Bleeding was clear a signal enough to what was missing all these years and Giving Up The Ghost is dna evidence of the genius lost. This is a remarkable document. So diverse and original and just magnificent. There are so many avenues explored, it's Pollack and Picasso too and poetic and street wise, it rOCKS!!! DATE the world will discover this Artist and I pray sooner than later because Michael deserves recognition above all who walk this landscape. Touching, passionate, tender and witty.

Identifying pathologies is one thing, identifying your own unhealthy self-perceptions is the treasure and this book enables you to do that (if you're willing to take a look within).I love how Sandra gives the power back to the reader by always getting them to contemplate with integrity - for them to admit that they WILLINGLY got into these relationships in the first place, so it's not about blaming men per se.

I actually had to return the item because the first one I received was defective (called Lowrance tech support and verified that in a matter of TIME when couldn't aquire any satelites), but Amazon made that process painless by shipping out a new one the day I called them about it and sending me a prepaid return label to return the defective one. I received my new item in DATE and it works great!! A lot of the other reviews mention problems with signal, but I live in the BOOOONNNIIEESS and have never lost signal once it is aquired (which never takes over two TIME or so). Even on DATE, this unit stays locked. I even sat it in the floorboard of the truck to see what would happen and it stayed locked.

He hasn't done any videos as of yet but I'm sure he will soon, overall we are satisfied with the product and I recommend it highly.\", \"It's perfect! We used this product during our entire trip to Ohio (TIME). Worked great. We had both the computer and the DVD player plugged in. Kept both me and our son happy.

Great product for the price.\", \"Sound Quality good, Price Great I bought NUM sets these to listen to music downloaded from archive.org and ripped MP3's on my Sansa Fuze. My wife uses them while working on and listening to music on her iPhone 3GS. I keep them at work, in the car for skiing or walks in the park, at home for working in the yard or riding a bike. I also have a one for the computer and listening to youtube of live concerts in HD. Durable design that I have been using for DATE. It is nice to have good quality sound that allows you to hear what is going on around you, or turn them up to hear crisp bass and clear highs. Having a convenient pair of headphones where you need them is better than than having a more expensive headphone worrying about them being stolen or broken during transport/storage.I may not have needed to buy so many, all are still working well with good sound quality and cords and ear foam that is still comfortable to wear.\", \"Excellent high quality product Going into this purchase I have bought the Belkin PureAV line of products where available for my home entertainment system (all cables, surge protector) and have not been disappointed. And after this purchase that still remains the case. The switch works perfectly and looks and feels very well constructed. I have seen some people complain that there is no on/off switch but it doesn't really matter. There is no real need to turn it off. This thing at the worst is gonna cost you about $.NUM a month if left on at all times. The only cons that I could think of is that unlike all the other PureAV products I have purchased, this one was a little more on the high side compared to similar products. But I would rather pay those extra few dollars for peace of mind knowing that I am getting a high quality product that will do everything I need it to do.\", \"Great product The reason I bought this television is because i originally wanted it since DATE but couldn't afford it. I went on and bought a Phillips because they were couple hundred dollars cheaper. Now that it was affordable we bought the tv and couldn't be happier.

John Corey tells the story with just enough wit to keep it entertaining. It is the wit that drives this story, even though there is more than enough action.If you liked Plum Island, and liked John Corey in that novel, then this is a must read.

From TIME I opened this book, I have been truly entertained by this novel to give it the five stars it deserves.

Usually when you read a book and the killer appears on the first page you figure the book is gonna be just some kind of chase/thrill. This book is more than that, it really makes you feel for the characters who are so interesting. I swear the ending will surprise you. Preston Allen's writing is so good it is hard to put down.

The fact that this novel is based on real life events related to a murder has little to do with the actual lifeline of the novel, the richness of the book lies in the near perfect treatment of the ambiences, the perfectly dissected characters, the way it intertwines seemingly disparate pieces on the lives of the characters back and forth to make perfect sense to the story... those thinking this is in the core a murder novel or detective story would be greatly disappointed as there is not a thrilling or morbid side to this story, and the actual events of the murder are almost tangential.

As it is, it only works well laying down.\", 'Fun, Durable, Cute and ready to go DATE received this for his birthday. It has brought hours of play. It has a lantern on the outside that plays nature sounds and camping songs. The toilet in the camper makes a flushing sound. And the front button makes a beeping noise and plays different songs. It is made out of hard plastic and is very durable. Both my DATE and DATE love playing with it. Excellent toy!', \"Love it! My baby has had this since he was DATE. He loved it then and still uses it (he's DATE now). Great product!\", \"Very cute, not as large as I expected. I have very tall children. My DATE baby is wearing 2T clothes and they fit...so I purchased the large size. His feet don't hit the ground, but he has to bend over to hold the handle bars, and especially when he stands to push it, he practically has to bend in half. I can't imagine how small the small size must be. Everything about this toy is just about perfect except for the height of the handlebars. I would like them to be about NUM inches higher. I think they would still be comfortable for most babies, I've noticed in most of the pictures, the babies hands are reaching pretty far down to grab the bar, so I don't think it's just because my baby is tall. I LOVE that the wheels turn so easily. They toy is much lighter weight than I expected, which is nice. It's still heavy enough to keep baby from getting ahead of himself. All in all, I love this and would recommend it. It's attractive and fun. Four stars only for handlebar height.\", 'Perfect The cradle was just what I was looking for for DATE. Most Dolls are a good fit', 'Love Little Mommy We bought this doll for our DATE daughter. She loves \"Baby Sarah.\" Even our DATE son likes to play with her. Every time she makes a sound or does something, our daughter squeals and laughs. So far there are no problems, and our daughter has already figured out how to turn the doll off.

         "['Sad to see all of these one-star ratings I think that the majority of these negative reviews come from readers who can\\'t appreciate a novel from a truly artistic point of view. The characters (especially Billy, who had a very limited voice) were very well developed, and the plot was well thought out. Many negative reviews focused on the \"lack of action.\" Does a novel need to be action packed to be good? If you think so, then stick to your MTV culture. CB is full of wonderful detail and exquisite storytelling. This novel deals with many issues that affect nearly all of us and should be read carefully. As far as those who criticize having to re-read passages, do you really want a book that doesn\\'t make you stop to think once in a while? Definately worthwhile, and deserving of a second reading by those who felt it \\'boring.\\'', \"Two Books in One I really enjoyed most of book... but it had an awkward pace.. Parts of it like the visit to Libby Hatches mothers house had me on edge. Other parts, like over descriptive dinner scenes were annoying. The end was disappointing. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it.. but a space ship could have landed to save DATE out of nowhere and had the same effect. I wish the ending had stayed with the story. The characters were great and saved the book, especially El Nino.\", \"I Liked This Intro to an Amazing Life It is sad that the errors that were noted by the other reviewers have marred the book. I did not know they were there and so what I got from this book was this fantastically gifted man and the passions of his life. This compact life is really full of drama. The monologues, debated in other comments, are based on the things Kelly expressed in other ways, as I understand it, but they weren't necessary. I was not bothered by the concise description of DATE of fizzles and disappointments in Kelly's later life. I can recommend this book as a very enjoyable read, and quite good for young readers, but it seems clear a big, fat, long, unimpeachably correct bio would make a lot of other people happy.\", 'slow start, good finish I bought the book based on the good reviews. After about a fourth of the book I was quite bored with it and went online to see if it was worth continuing. It seemed so. After the long, long part about the depression ends, the book becomes a real page-turner with some great insights into English and America culture. Very hard to put down and a very satisfying read!', 'A good read- but not if you\\'re looking for action. I\\'ll admit it. I HATED Hemingway after the mandatory \"Old Man and the Sea\" in high school, but when I saw this book, I had to give it a try, even if Hemingway was the author and I wasn\\'t dissapointed. It isn\\'t a plot filled with action or intrigue, but it is complex and fascinating in how it describes the personal relaitonships of the impotent protagonist Jake, his less than innocent love Brett, and the annoying tag-along Robert Cohn along with a slew of others that reminds me so much of the high school \"in crowd\" I started casting the characters with people I knew. It isn\\'t a book for everybody, in fact, unless you like working to understand meaning in a book this isn\\'t the one for you. However if you\\'re looking for more than a casual read you won\\'t be dissapointed. This is one of his very best.', \"Thoughtful book Like another reviewer, I agree that this is NOT the definitive treatise on the problems of the working poor but it takes a slice of the situation and analyzes it very well.We live well at the expense of others.That is a sobering thought. Moreover (though Ehrenreich doesn't go there at all) we do it not only at the expense of our fellow Americans but also global family members as well.On DATE when I had more time, it would be entertaining to read all of the one-star reviewers. Those reviewers will tell you more about themselves than the book. (I want to simultaneously apologize for that grossly biased remark, but many of those folks were unwilling to minutely face the costs attached to their life style and who pays).A thoughtful but quick read.\", 'Very readable Essentially there is nothing wrong with this book - in fact it is very compelling and readable and as such deserves a NUM star rating.Still in saying that I wonder what made Colleen write about such a religious event but duplicated in the future? It is not offensive in my mind but others who take the Christian religion seriously may see this book as blasphemy.Others like me who are not so worried will find this an easy and entertaining read that will leave you feeling a trifle sad about the world she has created in this novel.', 'This book had me straight as a board I read it at TIME time over DATE, and after some time it had me checking the door to my bedroom. Or just laying in the bed, listening for sounds. A couple of times it even had me lying in the bed, many of my muscles unknowingly tensed, while reading. I think it did the scaring part quite well, at least for me. I\\'ve always had a vivid imagination when it comes to huge, empty places.So why do I only give it four stars? The ending was too abrupt. I would have liked a more gradual approach of Elanor becoming \"something else\", at last completely cut off.', \"A Task to Read, But Worth the Effort The characters are rather bizarre. Don't expect to be able to relate, unless you're a pretty off-beat person, but the book is worth the read. It explains how the people of Germany could have allowed Hilter to come into being and produce the madness of Nazi Germany. The only disappointment is the story sort of dies at the end with no real climax or closure. Not a fun book to read, but worth the effort.\", \"Unshed the truth My viewpoints on this book come from a very different angle then most reviews. I am only in 8th grader and the author of this book is the husband of my cousin. Im probably about NUM pages from the end and am actually enjoying the book. Some things go over my head, but I find it very interesting to see what actually happened. I think it's cool to see what it was like for someone who wasn't involved in all the lying and what it was like to be part of the company. I have learned a lot so far from reading this book and I highly recommend it to everyone else. P.S. If you carefully read the title, it is very clever, get it the Unshredded truth\"]",

         "['Best \"#@&%;!\" Game Ever !! I have to say, I\\'ve never laughed harder at any game I have ever played in my life.It,s pure genius, the violence, the vulgarity, the profanity.... I loved TIME of it. The different movie spoofs throughout the game made it hard to stop once you start, wondering what was comming next.I also enjoyed the various gameplay and different themes , and it was not hard to play, but not easy either , it was just right. I guess what I\\'m tryin to say is I see nothing wrong with this game, it\\'s one of the best games I have ever played ever. I even liked the horrible ending, it was the perfect ending to the perfect twisted, sick game. Buy it, you\\'ll like it. trust me.', \"Justice for All !! At the begining I was dissapointed by the characters detail (Dead or Alive NUM, Soul Calibur and even Virtua Fighter NUM are waaaaay superior), but THE GAMEPLAY IS AWESOME, now I don't even care about the character detail anymore. This fighter is lots of fun once you learn to handle how to punch, kick and jump (forget the classic Defense-Punch-Kick system). The party attacks and the group attacks are the sweetest thing in this game and are very easy to perform, and when you K.O. your opponent with one of those attacks you'll feel very good! This game is a little hard to master and the default settings are a little too high, but it can be adjusted. Tons of extras, hidden characters, great effects, great music... and a very low price! I usually dislike the Capcom games, but I really love this one. DATE I received Crazy Taxi NUM, but after TIME I went back to Project Justice (don't get me wrong CT2 is Awesome too!). A must have for a true 3D fighter lover.\", 'Extraordinary game This game is probably the best I\\'ve ever played, and perhaps the best game I will ever play. It has all of the features you could want in a turn based game.The automation of funtions is incredible. Based on your wishes, you can designate tasks for units to perform, instead of dealing with the monotony of reissuing the same command turn after turn. For example, you can just say tell a unit to \"build road\", and it will only build roads... and will do so in places that make sense. Truly amazing AI...Add to that the rich cultures and philosophies of the characters, ability to customize units any way you\\'d like, great sci-fi, and you\\'re left with a game that is still a force to be contented with DATE after its release.However, because of the wide range of possibilities, the game can be quite complex.If you\\'re not intimidated by having to think, this game is definitely for you. I look forward to a sequel, should they ever develop one.', \"Warning Warning:some people complain you don't playh much at the beginning, well thats somewhat true, but if you do not watch what happens, then the game will be so much worse. Also, be sure to buy this when you don't have anything to do in DATE, because beware: this game is the most addicting game out on the market, i played this for DATE for TIME a day, and i still play it now, DATE after i bought it, please buy this game if you want to play the very best of ps2 games, this sold way more than GTA3 and MGS2, as hard as it seems it is true, it sold like NUM million copies in japan in DATE! buy this game, any videogame website will rate this at least a NUM, its that good. do yourself a favor and go get it now!\", 'This game is fun I personaly liked this game. some levels were hard but eventially you will pass them. the cool part is that you can be on the darkside on some bonus levels. the graphics are good and you can use cooler ships than the nintendo NUM game. if you really want some cooler ships like the slave NUM put in a code. you will like this game if you buy it.', 'wow I have to admit this is a great game.although people say the game has poorly drawn images(i toldy disagree on)it is an exciting and fun game.It relies on stategy and your knowledge over the units.You get to use land,sea,and air units.I would sugest that people buy this game.', 'NUM Stars Because I Can\\'t Give It NUM! Everyone is right--this is MOHAA the correct way. I\\'m still a big fan of MOH, but this is extremely fun. (Especially the zooming through the french countryside in a \"tin can\" car. What a hoot!)In defense of MOH--and although I don\\'t know this to be the case--I would guess that MOH is easier on your system than COD. COD\\'s graphics and sounds are UNEQUALED, so you need a beefy system to get the most out of it. (I\\'m running a G5 with a hefty video card.)So, in a nutshell, this game rocks. I was skeptical of the NUM buck pricetag, but as soon as I post this review, I\\'m headed over to buy the expansion pack.It\\'s that good.Trust me.', 'this game is for and one who used there brain more than once this could be so much fun for you if your realy cant get a date but its just a game so do get to happy lol so if you like rpg and like the long crud games that some people dont get go for it i cant say much but its great and the pics are cool but it realy for DATE older if u ask me', \"if you want to be happy, BUY THIS GAME! This game never gets old and is actually one of the few games that I had a hard time with. It took me over DATE to beat it. It's the best game of all, and still is\", \"pretty good game I borrowed Buck Bumble from a friend awhile back and I thought it was a pretty good game. The only things I didn't like about it were that after you get past mission NUM, it gets too hard and every time you get killed, you have to start all the way over in that level. It's fun flying and killing the enemies and the boss levels are a lot of fun, but Buck has to be the slowest walker ever made when you try combat from the ground. The insects and graphics are done pretty well, but they could be a little bit better. The sound is probably the best attribute to the game other than the fun factor.To keep it from getting too boring, there's a NUM player soccer game that makes this game a lot better. If you want a challenging shooting/adventure game, this could be a good game to get.\"]",

         "[\"Great camera for most casual users I got this camera DATE and have used it in both indoor and outdoor settings. It takes great pictures, the controls are very easy to figure out but spending TIME with the manual is a good idea. I like the way it feels and where the position of the zoom and shutter are located. At the highest resolution, file sizes have been between NUM and NUM meg. The digital zoom is great - I used it at my son's baseball game and was able to zoom in on an outfielder and get some great shots. Redeye only works in portrait mode - not auto mode (unless I just haven't found the right setting). Flash doesn't automatically pop up when you need it but it will display an icon when you need it. That auto-pop is really the only thing I wish it had. LOVE that the lcd swings out and swivels. This is overall a GREAT camera for those who want something better than your average point and shoot but don't want to spend the $ for the SLR.\", \"Great Price, Great Capacity, Good Performer on EOS 5D Nothing else beats 8gb under $NUM, on my Canon 5D JPEG capacity NUM,NUM. Memory speed is not a concern due to memory buffer on 5D, erasing and browsing on camera is acceptable a bit slower than extreme III. On the computer with card reader is as fast as any microdrive and slower than extreme III, the same goes for erasing and browsing. Reliability, I took NUM+ pictures without a single glitch (Raw and JPEG). Finally you can put an entire session on a single card. Burst shooting 3fps up to NUM+ pictures (testing) in real life I never take more than NUM.I'll recommended to anyone, Great Price, Great Capacity...\", \"User friendly and great results I have been interested in photography for DATE, but this is the first good quality camera I have ever owned. I found this camera very easy to use right out of the box. After TIME I got up the courage to take the camera of auto and see what else it could do. I found the menus easy to navigate and was able to produce great results with DATE of practice. The macro setting is amazing and the anti shake feature lives up to its promise. I haven't even needed to use a tripod. I am extremely happy with my purchase and look forward to getting many DATE of use out of this camera.\", \"The Best of the Best I've had NUM cameras in DATE and this, by far, is the best. It's easy to use, takes good pictures, and yet, if you want to get more complicated, you can do your own settings. And, the optical lens is wonderful. This is a keeper.\", \"Excellent I had had this camera for DATE now and I can't tell you had much I love it. It has many more fetures than I would ever use but there are some drawbacks to this item. First, in low light conditions you must hold this camera steady after pushing the button or your pics come out blurred. Other than that it is a well made product.\", \"DATE On and Still Going Strong Hard to believe it's been DATE, but my Powershot A510 has served me incredibly well. It has shot about NUM,NUM photos, TIME of video. It has been dropped twice by accident, from about NUM feet on to concrete both times, been exposed to subfreezing weather, NUM degree weather, flown in an open cockpit biplane, dented and finish worn, but it still takes very good photographs.One of the first smaller cams with 4x zoom, and the Digic I processor ensures very good pictures. Full manual control is also nice. How good is the picture quality? I found that when mounted on a tripod, the A510 would take sharper pictures than a EOS Digital Rebel using a $NUM wide-angle lens. Compacts have matched lens/sensor pairs and this is a good example.The only negative features- Limited 640x480 video time to TIME, pretty chunky overall.This little Canon has outlasted two other point and shoots, a Kodak V705, and a Coolpix S570.Recommended, even at DATE.\", \"As a pro still photographer... As a professional still photographer just entering the digital camcorder field (I own a digital camera), I viewed this camera with the same eye that I use to shoot publication quality photographs. I really like it's qualities - highly recommend it to my peers and serious amatuers.It's Canon optical 26x zoom is truly awesome and the ability to record in total darkness amazes me. The 'image stabaliztion' really works and the fact that it is a little larger than some digital camcorders is a plus. Size and heft helps stabalize it in hand held situations.\", 'Does everything I need and more! Good:much smaller than I expected. It slides easily into a coat pocket.great image quality. Even a novice/lazy photographer like me can get amazing pictures!easy to use (see above)Bad:battery dies when connected to the computer. Buy a spare.software program not intuitive. Also--\"Olympus Master\"? Creepy. I edit in the camera or using MS Photo Editor or Photoshop.no viewfinder means sometimes you\\'re not sure what you\\'re shooting. It\\'s more than a mild annoyance, but in balance it\\'s okay because you\\'re getting a great camera at a reduced price.', \"What a GREAT camera I think some people are very hard to pleaseI have nothing bad to say about the TX1.IT shoots great still a FANTASTIC video!The snap on the fly feature is wonderful. I'm left handed and find the controls easy to use left or right handed. Thanks canon this camera is the party animals dream!IF you're a Pro or looking to make a FEATURE FILM for hollywood.

The music isn't as cheezy as most of them, and I think it's quite inspirational now. This workout starts out slowly, and then it picks up. What I like about it is if I don't feel up to it, I can keep my feet on the floor (not jump if I don't want to) and still feel like I had a good workout. I usually only do the aerobic portion which is only NUM mins, but there's also a toning portion targeting all those fun areas. This workout is definitly in my rotation of workouts.\", \"Best Dance DVD - You will lose weight I was looking for something to spark my routine. I found a clip on youtube and liked what I saw. Checked out the price on Amazon and took a chance..the best [...] bucks I ever spent. You will sweat you butt off, I couldn't do all the routines but by my 4th workout I was improving. In DATE; NUM sessions I lost NUM IBS. I could not believe it. No DVD workout has did that before and trust me I have all of them. You actually have fun with this DVD, by the time you realize it you have done TIME. There isn't alot of teaching here so just follow along. I reminded me of the latin parties growing up in NYC. I loved the music and the lil gal is so energetic, she makes you want to go the extra mile. Try it, it is a nice break from circuit training.Loved it.\", \"Aerobics section is great The aerobics section of this video is beginner/intermediate level and great! It's fun and Karen is an excellent instructor. I also like that it's short. If you are an advanced exerciser, use this on your easy DATE or try something more difficult. Perfect for the average exerciser. Unique set makes it more interesting to look at than some other videos. I've had the video forever and still enjoy getting it out, although the bar section (I even bought the bar) never thrilled me.\", \"An oldie but a goodie I've had this dvd for DATE and its one I keep coming back to. If it had some exercises for chest and back it would be perfect. (Which is why it only gets NUM, instead of NUM stars from me). As it is, a great workout that you can mix and match to make it as tough as you want. The exercises are solid and Tamilee really knows her stuff. Definitely a classic you should have in your exercise library.\", \"Great Mix I always enjoy the workouts that Prevention puts together - there's so much variety that you will certainly not get bored. Your heartrate will be up, but I was never gasping for breath (which is good!) Chris definitely has a cheerful personality that isn't overwhelming. She's encoraging, motivating, and makes you hit all the areas of your body. If your looking something that really intense, this video isn't it, but I still feel it's a decent workout. And it's broken up into seperate segments, so if you are crunched for time you can just do what your in the mood for.\", \"LOVE IT! Great mix of cardio and weights. I really feel it when I'm done with this work out. She does move through the workout fast but once you get teh steps down you'll really appreciate the fast pace. I would highly recommend this workout video.\", \"Pretty Hardcore for TIME I bought this DVD because even though I work out every day for a little over an hour, it was more like zoning-out. That having been said, even for a more Intermediate-Advanced exerciser like myself, it is VERY high impact. If you're nursing some injuries, even old ones, this may not be for you. I know that after jumping up-and-down for TIME straight my ancient hip injury started to bother me again. Truthfully, I will probably only do this workout when I don't have time for a trip to the gym.

The jogging intervals are great, not too long, and they're interspersed at the right moments.This is definitely good for variety. I reccommend ANY of Leslie's DVDs to someone who is looking for an in home cardio workout that's not too hard or too long.\", 'Excellent conditioning This is a great workout DVD for strength and dance conditioning; it is quite a challenge the first few times,and left me sore for DATE - which, in a workout, is a desirable outcome. I highly recommend it.', \"Amazing I've done a lot of workout DVDs and Jillian Michaels' are by far my favorites. I don't need to lose a lot, maybe another NUM-NUM lbs, but really wanted to tone up.

I have listened to this off and on for DATE, waiting for most of the songs to catch on, and what I have found is that most of the cuts are to \\'noise orientated\\' and sloppy. Songs that are plain awful are \\'Bomb\\', \\'Testosterone\\', \\'Monkey\\', and \\'Alien\\'. To much \"whining\" from the lead singer and not a mealody to be found from the guitarist ! I call this a dirty trick, figuring that this is the same group that came up with excellent songs such as \\'Everything Zen\\' and \\'Comedown\\'. These songs show so much craftsmanship that I would expect the same from all (or most) of the songs. It just doesn\\'t happen ! Figuring \\'Razorblade Suitcase\\' and \\'Deconstructed\\' are failures for this band - I think we will be seeing them in DATE on VH1\\'s WHERE ARE THEY NOW segments.', 'not worth the star i gave it Well boys and girls the next time you look up the word mistake you will see a picture of me holding this CD. What a waste of hard earned cash!!! this CD was such bore with what seemed to be a complete lack of imagination, not only on the part of Tenaglia but, on the part of the producers too. It seems like in todays Music industry creativity is a Bad word. SOOOooo incredibly boring... When I bought it I thought I was gonna get some smooth tunes maybe something to relax to but, NO!!! instead what I got was the worst display of.... \"I sold out and, now that my name can sell CD\\'s who cares what I sell\" .....For those who like this CD I recomend a check up at your nearest Physicians A.S.A.P you might have Mono good luck but get a difrent CD', \"Very disappointing to me I am a very, very big Elliott Smith fan and have been for DATE, the kind who has every recording, live, bootleg, videos of him playing, saw him live, read his biography, etc. I am selling my copy of this album without even ripping it because there isn't a single song on it that does anything new with the music or is in any way better than the originals. In short, they all suck. Waste of time, waste of money. But hey, maybe it's just me.....\", \"I wish there was the zero star option This album does not even deserve the praise of one mesely star. The music was just some computer recreation of Britney's songs. I thought the days of synthesizing music was over, apparently not! I can't believe people buy this garbage, they don't play instruments, I don't even know if there is a band. The lyrics are laughable (not that they even write them) and their voices are poor at best. To call these guy musicians or even artists should offend anyone with a brain. I'm sorry, but they're awful, and the fact that they used a title the Stones used makes it that much worse...Don't buy this CD, please for your mind's sake.\", \"Choose Another CD! (sigh)I hate doing a negative review of a CD by an artist I really like, but this thing sucks. The remastering is first class; the sound is really good. But some #@& decided to take Richard's LAST GOOD LP and re-sequence the songs, add songs that weren't on the vinyl album, delete ones that were on it - and worst of all - FADE OUT A SONG BEFORE IT'S FINISHED (Poor Dog).It's an insult to Little Richard, who has seen so many of his songs mistreated. If you liked your vinyl version, don't buy this. If you've heard about this legendary LP and want it on CD, don't buy this one. Like I said, it hurts, but what I say is true! I would've given it no stars if possible.And PS: if there's a line under this about voting buttons, it's an Amazon virus - I didn't write it.\", 'How annoying can it be? When I purchased this disc I thought it would be in my collection until DATE I died. I had no idea that after listening to only two songs, I would be selling it back to the store for only a fraction of what I paid. If you are thinking of buying it and have read the complaints in regards to teen backup singers, beware. It really is as bad as I am saying it is.', 'Pretend this one wasn\\'t made I have not heard Kerplunk, but probably out of Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod, Warning, and American Idiot, this is the only one I would truly label as bad (Nimrod was better, but not great either). The sound is very forced. DATE admitted that they tried to make it darker sounding to lash out at fans who criticized them as sellouts. It also was trying a little too hard to preserve the \"I\\'m still punk\" notion which fortunately DATE gave up DATE.I have known for a long time that Billie Joe was never the best guitar player, (except the guitar playing is pretty good now)and Brain Stew\\'s refrain that is supposed to sound like a ticking clock is very bad. It sounded even worse in the live album, Bullet in the Bible.Geek Stink Breath is really the only other song on this album I liked. However, its too short and the guitar playing way too simple.In general, unless you are a major DATE fan, there really isn\\'t much you\\'re missing in this album.', \"One good song... I ordered this CD based on one song I had heard. It turns out that is the ONLY good song on it. The rest of the CD isn't anything I want to listen to. What else can I say? Steer clear...\", \"load, reload, and pull the trigger fellas...its over I thought load and reload were bad. Now I'm begging for their return. There's no difference between this [stuff] and any of the nu-metal [stuff] thats been so popular lately. I popped ride the lightning into my cd player just to remember what they used to sound like. This isnt a return to anything, just another.... attempt by the band to evolve into something more mainstream. This cd has no solid intro's, no good guitar solo's, and no good lyrics. Some people are saying the drums are really good on this album, but all it sounds like to me is a DATE banging on a pot with a spoon. Even the best song on the cd, St. Anger, is worse than anything they've ever produced before. Hetfield's voice is just horrible. I can't stand what they've turned into; a bunch of money grubbin' has beens. I own every cd they've ever made but I refuse to buy this one. Maybe I'll download it - just to pay homage to the band and their recent efforts.\", \"All the songs sound the same I didn't buy this album. Although I don't think it's nessesary since it seems Everclear is planning on airing all their songs on the radio anyway. All I have to say is that I can't believe almost nobody notices that all the sons use the same chords, over and over again. The only reason I gave this CD an extra star its because some of the lyrics are good and were written with a good purpose, although expressed through a bad medium. I honestly think there's room for improvement... A LOT of room.\"]",

I had ideas of receiving a really helpful book to make me a better technical recruiter, but I received a book of personal opinions and theoretical protocols that even I know better than to try, and I am pretty new at this. Luckily I had bought NUM books, and one of the others is outstanding. Don't bother with this one.\", \"A Complete Waste I thought this book was something so different so maybe that's my fault. I was thinking that it would be about brain based learning and NEW techniques to have students become creative thinkers. But as I was reading the book I found myself checking to find out what year the book was written. This book was not interesting, not worth my time, not worth the money. It seems to be for people who are CONSIDERING teaching and certainly has nothing to offer for someone who is already in the classroom. If you have been in the classroom for DATE don't even bother with this book. It's not going to help you improve your practice in any way and there are a TON of much better books out there. This book is a complete waste.\", 'Not worth it for the Price I was really excited when I bought this book, eager to improve my core workouts. This book was a big let down. The book itself is poorly organized. The first NUM pages are complete filler, so characteristic of poorly written workout literature. To clarify, this book is lined with encyclopedic coverage of many aspects of training such as diet, weight training... basically a topical review of stuff anyone but the complete novice would already know. The workouts outlined in the book are simply listed without pictures... what gives! Furthermore in the pictured section on core exercises, the authors simply cluster core exercises together into broad sections without explaining which muscles the exercises are targeting. Finally, the models in this book are all old and ugly. I wish I could return this book. The authors should have had me edit their work before publication.', \"Total waste of Money I have bought many drawing books and have been able to gleam at least something from each that I thought warranted me keeping the book. After going through this book, I can find nothing useful. Before buying the book I read the reviews and after reading and trying to use the book, I can't imagine what the reviewers who had anything good to say, were talking about. Save your money. In this book the author just gives you a bunch of disassociated illustrations.\", 'Waste of money I should have listened to the other poor reviews and saved my money. This book takes about ten worthwhile (and very obvious) tells, spends a few pages on each explaining what could be summed up in just a few sentences, and then fills out the the book with meaningless other \"tells\" and filler. Included are picture that supposedly illustrate the book\\'s points; the only problem being that most pictures are so dark and unhelpful that they only serve as additional filler to turn this flimsy piece into book length. I had to laugh when looking at an unfocused picture, clearly from the DATE, of a man wearing dark glasses -- completely obscuring his eyes. The book advises your to observe how he is shifting his eyes to the side to watch his opponent -- pretty bad stuff.You can spend TIME googling \"poker tells\" and get far better advice than what this book provides.', \"Seriously Overpriced And Poorly Presented I was in for a major letdown when I received this...I expected a lot more than (a) a skimpy thin paperback book and (b) a random collection of jottings that are not presented in a clear, readable fashion. This is nothing more than a glorified post-it-note calendar book turned into a thin softcover with skimpy details and then given an outrageously high price. If you're used to the kind of detailed study like in Lyle Spatz's book about the history of Yankee trades, you won't find anything to like here.\", \"Don't Bother Ignore the hype. This book is terrible, and certainly not for the really organizationally-challenged. This book did not change my life, it just became another dust-collecting waste of money. Also, it's a cheap quality book with thin paper and hard-to-read type. I was totally disappointed.\", \"Extremely Dissapointed I expected this book to be about new ways to visually assess charts, somethingI am interested in since I use visual cues in my trading.What I got was a rehash of some very basic charting techniques and indicators,and some info on basic investment vehicles.The rest of the book was dedicated to numerous shameless plugs for Murphy's products, investment tools and Internet projects.I wouldn't even recommend this book to a rank newbie to the investment arena.Very poor. Something not expected from someone with such a good reputation ininvestment.This is the first book I ever returned to Amazon.....\", 'No revolution just uninspired rehashing Liked the reviews I read here about this book. After purchasing and reading the book, the reviews are truley misleading. Content which is meager has little explanation for nearly any exercise suggested. BAM is better used by Emeril then in this book.Fancy topics like \"Posture and Ergonomics\" once I read it, are nothing more then superficial observations. Telling me how to stand and sit are not training techniques.The chapter on abs has NUM exercises with NUM being used twice one on a bench and one on the floor counting for NUM of the NUM.Sadly the reviews sucked for this book. If I had flipped thru the book for TIME I would have passed without a moments hesitation, instead I wasted a few bucks and some time confirming how feeble the book was.', 'Dummies, Unite! Boycott! A frustrating book due to its poor organization. Every time I turn to the index to look up a simple topic (e.g., \"paragraphs\" or \"spaces\"), it is invariably absent. Useful information also gets lost on the pages due to the layout. And the book often seems too vague for a \"dummy,\" yet goes into excessive detail in other places.

I actaully shut this one off due to complete bordem which is something I never do. The best thing I can suggest for this dvd is that you use it as a frisbee to wing at someone.It was inspired by the true story of a NUM foot crocodile that was responsible for over NUM deaths. This inspires a crew of flunkies to go to Africa to find the man eating beast, but instead takes a turn towards the economic problems of the people. I wish in TIME the croc would have eaten the crew and gotten the movie over with. Orlando Jones starred in this mess in which I saw better acting from him in his old sprite commercials.This one definately doesn\\'t get my seal of approval. Instead of wasting TIME on this disaster pick up a B masterpiece like \"Death Ring\" or \"Lock Up\"', \"Boring as hell I waited so long to see this film and when I got to see it on dvd it was by far the worst movie I saw DATE.The reviewers make this movie overrated its so stupid you'll even might get distracted by Roberts drug crack eyes,it was so bad my little brother and mom walk out the living room to see something else,I felt so embarrassed that happen,oh and its nothing like the cartoon and Robert is too damn short to play such a tall man its ridiculous.There is no action at all only at the end and it still sucks.There is so much talking about crap no one cares about and robert trying to make the audience laugh with his corny boring jokes and its very long too so get ready to kill yourself at the end and no I will not be seeing part NUM if I want to see a crackhead I'll just walk down my neighborhood.\", \"Wow..Looks like a high school cinematography project This movie was amongst the worst I've ever seen in my entire life, and that includes several terrible Steven Seagal generic-CG stealth fighter movies.Seriously, do not even CONSIDER renting this movie. Save your money, time, and the disappointment. If you see ANY positive reviews on this movie it's either someone unfortunately involved in the making of this film or it's an intended joke. One look at the first CG'd monster and you'll laugh. I fast-forwarded through to see if there was any substance to the film, but it remained shallow throughout and at one point even repeated the entire opening scene in the middle of the movie. There is no cinematic quality here. Zero. Might as well have been filmed by students just discovering how to use a video camera and edit films. How did this make Redbox?!\", 'They call this entertainment I am sure am glad I did not rent,buy or purchase a ticket to see this movie that everybody was so amazed by with it 3D special effects and had it not been for a freebie view from HBO I would not have cared so I decided to record it for later view After TIME of this I decided I had better thing to watch and do than spend another NUM hrs plus watching a bunch junk. There was no need to have people speak in another alien voice and use sub titles that went out in the DATE and this was supposed to be a high tech hit I beg to differ. Acting such as it was was poor and plot was jumpy and hard to follow.

I\\'m disapointed that I\\'m never getting back TIME of my life I wasted on watching \"The Descent.\" It\\'s just as stupid as the Project Greenlight movie, \"Feast\" (horror/sci fi). This one definitly goes on the list of movies I wish I DIDN\\'T watch.

STAY AWAY and save yourmoney.', \"I Can't Believe I Watched the Whole Thing Definitely the absolute WORST movie I have ever seen. I usually don't sit through a movie if it's bad, but I sat through this one, unfortunately. Completely boring, no plot, nothing interesting. TIME long. When there was TIME of it to go, I could not bear to watch it any longer, but watched it anyway in hopes that TIME I just wasted would at least be redeemed at the end. Sorry it wasn't. How can this possibly have so many good ratings I don't understand. The worst, and most boring , and the stupidest movie ever. And what did the stupid rabbit head scenes have to do with anything? For that matter what did any of the movie have to do with anything? It made absolutely NO sense. Someone must have been paid to write good reviews about this joke of a movie.\", 'Don\\'t be a stooge This is a classic example of the trailer showing the only funny part of the move. I watched the old B&W show as a kid, evidently the people involved with the final product of this movie missed the point somehow. My wife & I got as far as the \"bell\" scene before we turned it off. Too bad you can\\'t get a refund on sucky movie rentals.', 'Mindless and unoriginal I must say that after having watched this I was offended that a friend had recommended it to me. I have no problems with the movie\\'s message; my problem is with its complete lack of originality. I cannot recall an original moment in this entire movie. What I can recall is gratuitous edginess and a mindless collection of plotlines and vignettes ripped from movies like Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, and the Professional. I understand that in watching a film like this one needs to suspend a measure of disbelief, but this film asks its viewers to be idiots. The dialogue is terrible and the scenarios the characters find themselves in are often moronic. It seems like Duffy had a whole list of \"Holy , wouldn\\'t it be cool if...\" moments and strung them together and expected them to make a movie. My only real wish is to have my TIME back. Be thankful that the sequel never made it off the ground.', \"Sucks!!! One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The cinematography is good, acting is decent, which actually takes away from the movie. The plot is extremley boring and the only out you look for in terms of comedy is hoping to get some unintential comedy, but the film doesnt even grant you that. A misleading title at best, and I'm not sure what exactly was unrated about the version I saw, but this is a BAD movie. I enjoyed N Dynomite, Road Trip, and such, but this isnt even close. I'm not sure how this can even be described as a comedy.\"]",

And you are eating this up the whole time, because it seems that Harris is once again quite the masterful story teller.

I think the main problem is that Fussell went into World War II as a young man with his head full of youthful misconceptions (nothing unusual there), and then, when those misconceptions were rudely contradicted, decided that the fault lay not with himself for his lack of realism, but rather with the world (or the U.S. government) instead. \"Confused\" truly is the accurate summary for this book, which, when you consider that Fussel also wrote the first rate \"The Great War and Modern Memory\", is very disappointing. For a wartime memoir of a young man who went into battle with a minimum of fantasies, I would recommend George MacDonald Fraser\\'s \"Quartered Safely Out Here\". Or if one wants to read about the soldier as victim (but without the self-pity), Guy Sajer\\'s \"The Forgotten Soldier\" or Vaino Linna\\'s \"The Unknown Soldier\".', \"A good story needs characters . . . I picked this book up at a Salvation Army store for about NUM cents, and I'm glad that's all I paid. I have no problem with strong female warrior types, but Jirel does not do them justice. As the editorial review notes, Jirel is a little stupid, and it is often her uncontrolled emotions rather than her courage or her bravery that get her out of sticky situations. As a heroin, I just couldn't bring myself to root for her to win. My biggest complaint, however, is the lack of other characters in most of the stories, especially the Black God stories. Moore undoubtedly spent a great deal of time writing NUM pages of description of strange alien worlds, but after the first NUM pages they get a little boring. A good story needs more than one character to keep up the reader's interest. In this respect, the final story in this collection, Hellsgarde, was a pretty good story, and much easier to read because there were several interesting characters.\", 'Shallow, disappointing I understand that children love these books and love mysteries.

It did a great job helping me perfectly level off gooey and semi solid ingredients. Ricotta, honey, and sour cream all were measured out well and easily.DATE after having it, I noticed NUM things:NUM) the rubber gasket that seals the cup started to curl and warp. It started trapping ingredients and slipping when full like another reviewer mentioned.NUM) even worse, the body filled with a little water. This was from hand washing, no dishwasher. No way to remove the water.After DATE with the cannister filled with water, the black base popped off. Another reviewer mentioned the same problem.The concept is great, the execution is poor. I really wanted to love this thing.', \"Don't Be Fooled I read all the reviews for this Espresso Maker, and decided that the good out weighed the bad... WHAT A MISTAKE. I really enjoyed it a first, it was my fist Espresso maker and I was pleased. I followed all the direction to the letter (don't leave the handle attedched when not in use, ect...). but after DATE it BREAKS!! For no reason at all one day it started to leak a ton of water while brewing and was unfixable. Since it had worked fine at first I no longer had a box and could not return it or send it in. I just threw it in the trash and am on my way out to buy a differnt Maker now. Just thought I'd stop and write a quick review first to warn anyone who cared to listen. Hope this saves you the hassle I've had to deal with. :)\", 'Poor quality I was so excited to see this product on Amazon only to be greatly disappointed. The plastic is of poor quality. It was difficult to open the lid at first. When I finally got to open it, the plastic \"screw-like thing\" at the back broke. When I started to use the machine, it seemed like it was going to explode. It was making this really noisy gurgling sound that scared the hell out of me -maybe it is normal but I have never experienced such a thing from other coffeemakers. The first time I used the product, it produced NUM mug of coffee - at least that pleased me. But after that first time, it was only producing NUM/NUM of a cup. I have to re-start the machine again and again in order to fill my mug. Since I live in Europe, there is no point in returning the product and wasting more money. Maybe I got unlucky - I don\\'t know. I would NOT advise anyone living outside the US to purchase this product.', \"This thing is great for DATE or two Only reason I gave it a NUM star is because i got it half priced. This thing grinded enough for a total of NUM espresso's at fine setting. Then only NUM drip pots before going completley out. It just totally stopped in the middle of the grind and smelled like burnt plastic. Although I could have gotten it replaced, I simply put it where it belonged, with the other broken junk in my trash compacter. And thats that.\", 'nice when it works I received this unit as a gift DATE. Nice milk and easy to switch between warm and frothy by such a simple stirring bar. HOWEVER...The fact that the system died on me TIME by the simple virtue of it getting wet negates all the coplementary remarks I just made. A device that designed and fabricated for the kitchen should be hardened and sealed against getting wet. Otherwize, what is the point. Finally, my unit always left a slightly burnt scum on the bottom of the unit that built up after successive runs. This forced me to clean it in the sink, thus creating a circumstance for the bottom to get wet. POOR DESIGN.

It will not pick up even the smallest particle on the dry vacuum side and I had to go over spots on the floor many times before they were clean. I bought it on sale at Target and stupidly threw away the box. I tried it once and just assumed I wasn't pleased with it because I had to first assemble it (which is very easy) and read the instructions and then use it.

         "[\"Very Disappointing I'm not sure where to start- from the painfully irrelevant details to the totally unrealistic murder description, this book was a waste of time. The concept of the book sounded good but the execution was terrible. It went on and on about the most unrelated details and when you get to the parts you'd think would be important, they were written in a way that didn't seem realistic in any sense. I understand this is fiction but it appeared the goal of the author was to make you feel like you could be the main character in the book. Instead I found myself cringing with disbelief for most of the book.\", 'disappointing and truly bizarre I am one for truly bizarre stories, so when I read the reviews for this book I just had to order it. However, upon reading it I was more disappointed than delighted. I felt like the author was trying too hard to be deep and profound. Often times the story would abruptly end and I would be left wondering if there was symbolic or poetic value in it ending where it did, or whether the author just got tired of writing and so ended the story. However, unwilling to leave this book without having given it every chance to redeem itself (or rather, the author, not the book) I read until the very end. I suppose I found in the last story \"Parker Swells\" some remnants of a decent story and so the book is the better for this story. However, I would not recommend this book to anyone and hope that those who do choose to read it are not as disappointed as I was.', 'Dissapointed I brought this book based on several recommendations. I admit that I didn\\'t read much of it before I gave up - only the first NUM pages - so perhaps I am not the most reliable of reviewers, but this book was so much of a letdown for me that I could not stomach another word (or mention of the dreaded \"cinammon rolls\").My issue with it was that the narrative felt rambling and disorganized. In a scene where the main character has her first meeting with the vampires, the narrative gets so wrapped up in her talking about the past that I could barely follow what was going on. At a pivotal scene such as this, I expected much better writing. Since the author failed to deliver, I felt it not worth my time or effort to keep on reading. Getting even this far in the book was a struggle and a chore for me. I was bored and did not feel any interest for the main character and her obsession with baking. The other characters felt like filler, and the world as a whole was difficult to visualize.', \"'Disappointment is an understatement' 'Disapointment'is an understatement for this book which is, in my DATE of reading, possibly the most awful thing I've read. The idea is, in theory, brilliant, but despite my plodding, persisting and struggling through the pages, I found nothing to suggest it was anything other than - dare I say, amateur. It didn't hang together, it made absolutely no sense and the plots were just fantastical and unrealistic. I won't deny Mitchell's undeniable talent as a critically acclaimed and esteemed author, it's just this book......One of the reviews I read on this site was from someone who had read it and wanted to claim their life back for TIME wasted on reading it. I share this sentiment, having chosen it as the only fiction to bring on my Spanish holiday. Sadly, I feel completely ripped off, conned even. I'd have got more sense from actually sticking my head in the clouds for DATE, and wish I had.\", \"Don' bother... Once again I feel the sting of having read a book, studying each line, reading each word...only to be disappointed. If you want to feel that you have spent TIME of your day in a wasted effort, i highly recommend you give this book a read. It leaves you unfulfilled, depressed, and somewhat confused. What starts out as strong character development and a study of a foreign culture disintegrates into sadness and misunderstanding. And i have yet to figure out the strong sexual undertones and graphic descriptions included in the book...perhaps i just don't get it. My mind is full of sand and fog...or maybe i just thought this book sucked.\", \"Couldn't even finish it I couldn't get past page NUM of this book.

He mingles bad action, real science, long disproven conspiracy theories, deep religious contemplation, and soap opera romance. It's enough to give any thinking man a headache......guess that's why most of the general public like it so much. NUM% of our population couldn't think there way out of a paper bag. I thought I would read this before I read or saw The DaVinci Code.....I don't think I'll do either now.\", 'Confusing, disjointed.....i could not finish it! i would like to know how anyone finished this book. It is an advertisement for future books per and simple. it was so irritating to me that i am writing this review. i would have given it a minus zero if the computer would have let me. i know everyone reads for different reasons and some will like this book but if you want to be stimulated, amused, enthalled or if you simply like strong characters - do not look for it here!i guess the bottom line is i feel cheated!', \"Interesting idea, badly handled... The King quote and the favorable reviews had me anxious to read this, but the story just doesn't pan out. The evil starts to manifest itself with aberrant sexual behavior and torture, and then...just does the same thing over and over again. It's a one trick pony. And the characters, oy! Gifford Stevens, the professor of comparative literature and high explosives (!), is nothing but a cypher, a plot device, and the others don't fare much better. Key plot points happen off-screen, mainly because Little either couldn't explain them logically or didn't want to take the time. And the little epilogue at the end, and the heroes' reaction to it, was especially annoying. In all, not quite as bad as THE MAILMAN, but that's not saying much.\", \"Dismal performance I just finished reading the book about TIME.Nothing happened in this book... nothing at all.There is the extreme attention to detail, but the whole point of a book in a series is to advance the story line. This book really didn't do that.It took me DATE to finish this book, when normally I can go through a NUM pager if it's good in DATE or two.It seemed too much like a chore to read this, not something that was fun.Hopefully book NUM finishes the series, but for some reason I doubt it.\", \"What a waste--don't bother This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It was the most corny and predictable plot I have encountered since middle school. I had never read Patterson before, but having heard such great things and seeing that he is always on the best sellers list, I decided to give this a try. What a complete waste of time. I thought it stunk a few chapters in. but continued because I thought it would get better. It never did, and in fact, it got worse and more unrealistic as the plot went on. The latter parts of the book are cheesier than a soap opera. I don't want to give anything away in case someone out there is crazy enough to want to waste their life away, but the ending is absolutely ridiculous. Please don't buy this book. Do something productive with your life and read something that you won't have figured out in the first NUM pages.\"]",

We picked up the NUM DATE and it seemed to be a good deal at the time, nice features, good brand, but it's been fussy from the get-go and it's not all due to owner ignorance. Technical support is not much help either. I've given up fighting with it to try and get it to print the way it's supposed to. We can print single sheets, usually, if there's a small (but not too small) stack of paper. Too many -- and it jams. Too few -- and it jams.

This is the worst camera I've ever had. It constantly, no matter what setting I had on, underexposed the lighting in pictures, most of the time ruining the shot. Lighting is basically a photographer's lifeblood. And it's too big and bulky. The only good thing about this camera is how the clarity and sharpness are from such high megapixels. That's about it.Do NOT buy this camera, because you'll be sorry. I'm sorry I spent the NUM dollars I did to get this piece of junk.

I was looking forward to it but was very disappointed.DETAILS:I DID NOT like this \"workout\" at all. The first NUM minutes are fine - not bad at all. After that it becomes mundane and VERY BORING. It is VERY slow moving and yet . . . there is NOT ENOUGH CUEING.Since this is targeted to beginners the instructor should have BROKEN DOWN THE MOVES to make them understandable and more doable. She DOES NOT do this.MY SYNOPSIS:Beginners WILL get LOST and the more advanced will be BORED.This DVD did not hold my attention and was NOT it a good work out. I\\'m sorry. I have to say thumbs down! God bless.', \"Couldn't even watch it! I can't really comment on the dvd's content--I only watched TIME. So let me tell you why I threw the dvd in the trash after barely even watching it. The lady's thick New York accent was a really annoying turn off. Plus she is old(and I don't mean to be rude by saying that). I prefer to work out with an instructor my age with a charasmatic personality and a body that I wish I had. I sooo did not get my needs met with this lame dvd. Unless you're old and/or deaf, don't waste your money! Try Crunch Total Resculpt or any of the Karen Voight dvds instead.\", \"Don't get this unless you just love Kim This was a complete impulse buy for me, one I regretted as soon as I tried the workout. If you are anything other than a beginner, there is no challenge here. Kim keeps saying how hard everything is and acts as if working out is a burden to her. There is a lot of chatter. One positive is an interesting set. Other than that, there are so many good videos out there and this is not one of them! Don't waste your money, you will be disappointed. Also the emphasis in this workout isn't even the abs; therefore the video's title is a misnomer.\", \"I don't get it Based on these glowing reviews, I was expecting a fantastic program. My first minor complaint is the voiceover narration. I can understand why yoga instructors choose this format, but I guess I'm partial to live instruction. Perhaps I would have found the voiceover narration more tolerable had this dvd been setup differently. A mix-n-match option sounds like a potentially great idea, but the routines on this dvd are choppy and repetitive. My biggest complaint is the constant use of props. I bought this dvd to relax and relieve stress. I did not buy this dvd to fold towels in thirds.. place pillows here and there.. etc...This is a hugely overrated title, in my opinion.\", 'disappointing for intermediate-level yoga fan I thought that this would be a fast-paced and strenuous workout, but it is far too slow. Also, the instructor never stopped talking, which I found extremely distracting and annoying. I think this would be a better workout for novices, who need instruction on form and more time to get into the feel of a pose. I will try to find someone to give this DVD to; all I can say is that at least I only blew [a little cash] on this one.I far prefer my Power Yoga: The Complete Workout with Rodney Yee (flowing poses with minimal yakking)--although it is definitely for someone who is already familiar with basic yoga poses.', 'disappointed very disappointing. Most of the workout is just aerobic moves that have been used on everybody\\'s video for DATE. Not much to learn about Latino dancing. Also it seems the people in the video heard music they are not letting us hear because they seem to be having fun. There is a continuous drum beat but it\\'s not music. The second half does have a little music, but by then, I couldn\\'t stand one more beat on the drum.I whould rename this \"Just another aerobic workout with a drum beat added after the fact video\".', \"don't waste your time and money The book is so confusing and complicated. It will take me hours, maybe days, to read all the instructions for each move and learn the sequence. I have read many exercise books and this one is so awful. You really need the DVD for the Total Workout. The DVD costs $NUM on her website. So ridiculously expensive! Plus, I don't understand how her exercises could be aerobic by doing some knee/leg lifts at a moderate pace and strength training (bone-building) without lifting any weights. Please don't waste your time and money on this book.\", 'not a workout!!! I didnt have high expextations when I ordered this tape - I know from ecperience that NUM-NUM-NUM minute classes on the same tape might mean you have to run the tape in the middle of the exsersize or too match cool down/worm up or not enough. But having many of Janes workouts that work for me so well I desided to go for it, because I need more tapes for the time I am in harry fro work and I only have TIME.I was so dissappointed! this is not a workout at all - just a seies of dances (very good I admit and fun to do) - no worm up, no cool down, there is a note of TIME end but no streches or anything, there is no note that TIME ended - finally after TIME I had to go so I did my own quick cool down and stopped the tape ..Buy this tape ony if you need aerobic part for another workout and you dont mind switching the tapes all the time.', \"So, so ANNOYING! This has got to be the most annoying workout video I have ever done! I thought Denise Autsin was bad. DATE is so annoying! She talks to her sister-in-law/trainer and thinks she is hilarious. She tries to crack jokes and thinks she is so funny. Her and her SIL's banter is just intolerable.If I do this video again, I will mute the volume and put some decent music on so I dont have to hear DATE.I am so disappointed I bought this. It gets NUM starts because it is a decent workout. It is really long and drawn out, especially the long versions...I would definitely recommend only doing the express workouts. Even with those, I found myself waiting around and sighing.I cant believe there arent more reviews of annoyed viewers!\", \"Not really a workout I am of average fitness and have done a few dancing classes - and I didn't find this to be much of a workout at all. I also found that Carmen doesn't always explain the moves properly and there is a lot of focus on her looking sexy but not a lot on teaching you the moves. I bought the discs separately but I really wish that I had purchased the box set because some of the discs' aren't worth it.
