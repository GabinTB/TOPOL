         "Ben S Bernanke: Fedspeak\nSpeech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the meetings of the American Economic Association, San Diego, 3 January 2004.\nThe references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.\n* * *\nThere was a time when central bankers did not talk to the public. Montagu Norman, the Governor of\nthe Bank of England for a quarter of a century after the First World War and a highly influential figure\nin his time in central banking circles, was notorious for his reclusiveness, both personal and\nprofessional. According to his biographer, Norman lived by the maxim, \"Never explain, never excuse\"\n(Boyle, 1967, p. 217). Norman was hardly unique. Central bankers long believed that a certain\n\"mystique\" attached to their activities; that making monetary policy was an arcane and esoteric art that\nshould be left solely to the initiates; and that letting the public into the discussion would only usurp the\nprerogatives of insiders and degrade the effectiveness of policy.\nIn contrast to this tradition of secrecy, central banks around the world have become noticeably more\nopen and transparent over the past fifteen years or so. Policymaking committees have adopted\nvarious mechanisms to enhance their communication with the public, including more informative policy\nannouncements, post-meeting press conferences, expanded testimony before the legislature, the\nrelease of the minutes of policy meetings, and the regular publication of reports on monetary policy\nand the economy.\nThis increased openness is a welcome development, for many reasons. Perhaps most important, as\npublic servants whose policy actions affect the lives of every citizen, central bankers have a basic\nresponsibility to give the public full and compelling explanations of the rationales for those actions.\nBesides satisfying the principle of democratic accountability, a more open policymaking process is\nalso likely to lead to better policy decisions, because engagement with an informed public provides\ncentral bankers with useful feedback in the form of outside views and analyses. Yet another benefit of\nfull and timely release of information about policy decisions and their rationales is a reduced risk that\nmarket-sensitive information will dribble out through inappropriate channels, giving unfair advantage to\nsome financial market participants.\nAdmittedly, for many central banks, including the Federal Reserve, progress toward greater\ntransparency has come in halting steps and not without trepidation. For example, the decision to\nannounce changes in the target for the federal funds rate immediately after meetings of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) was implemented only in phases and after considerable\nsoulsearching by FOMC members. In retrospect, however, I think that most central bankers, both in the\nUnited States and abroad, would agree that greater openness has been beneficial to central banks as\ninstitutions and for the advancement of their policy objectives.\nAlthough the presumption today is that - absent compelling reasons to the contrary - central banks\nshould strive for transparency, some basic questions about what, how, and to what end central banks\nshould communicate with the public remain decidedly open. In my talk today I will put aside broader\nconsiderations such as democratic accountability and consider these questions as they bear on the\nability of central banks to make monetary policy more effective and to improve macroeconomic\nperformance. Before proceeding, I should emphasize that the views I will express today are not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\nWhy central bank communication matters for policy effectiveness\nCan central bank talk - Fedspeak, in the vernacular of the U.S. media and financial markets - make\nmonetary policy more effective and improve economic outcomes? To see why communication may be\nan integral part of good monetary policymaking, recall that the Federal Reserve directly controls only a\nsingle short-term interest rate, the overnight federal funds rate. Relative to the enormous size of global\nfinancial markets, the market for federal funds - the market in which commercial banks borrow and\nlend reserves on a short-term basis - is insignificant. Control of the federal funds rate is therefore\nuseful only to the extent that it can be used as a lever to influence more important asset prices and\nyields - stock prices, government and corporate bond yields, mortgage rates - which in turn allow the\nFed to affect the overall course of the economy.\nOf course, basic financial theory implies that a link does exist between short-term interest rates, such\nas the federal funds rate, and longer-term rates, such as Treasury bond yields and mortgage rates. In\nparticular, longer-term yields should depend in part on market expectations about the future course of\nshort-term rates. For example, with the current setting of the funds rate held constant, any arriving\nnews that leads bond market participants to expect higher future values of the funds rate will tend to\nraise bond yields and lower bond prices. The link between long-term bond yields and market\nexpectations of future monetary policy actions is familiar to all financial-market participants and has\nbeen well supported by recent empirical research. For example, Antulio Bomfim has demonstrated\nthat the shape of the term structure of Treasury yields can be effectively described by a two-factor\nmodel, in which the first factor corresponds to the current setting of the funds rate and the second\nfactor closely approximates medium-term monetary policy expectations (Bomfim, 2003).\nThe fact that market expectations of future settings of the federal funds rate are at least as important\nas the current value of the funds rate in determining key interest rates such as bond and mortgage\nrates suggests a potentially important role for central bank communication: If effective communication\ncan help financial markets develop more accurate expectations of the likely future course of the funds\nrate, policy will be more effective (in a precise sense that I will explain further soon), and risk in\nfinancial markets should be reduced as well.\nIt is worth emphasizing that the predictability of monetary policy actions has both short-run and\nlong-run aspects. A central bank may, through various means, improve the market's ability to\nanticipate its next policy move. Improving short-term predictability is not unimportant, because it may\nreduce risk premiums in asset markets and influence shorter-term yields. But signaling the likely action\nat the next meeting is not sufficient for effective policymaking. Because the values of long-term assets\nare affected by the whole trajectory of expected short-term rates, it is even more vital that information\nrelevant to estimating that trajectory be communicated. As I will argue later, this can usually be done\nonly by providing information about the central bank's objectives, assessment of the economy, and\npolicy strategy.\nCommunication, asymmetric information and learning\nIdeally, what should central bank communication try to achieve? In an important analysis of the issue\nof central bank transparency, my FOMC colleague William Poole laid out a benchmark case in which\nthe potential benefits of communication would be fully realized (Poole, 2003). In this benchmark case,\nthe central bank has well-defined objectives and pursues regular and systematic policies consistent\nwith those objectives. More important for our purposes, in this idealized world, financial markets are\nhighly efficient and well informed. In particular, financial-market participants have access to all the\ninformation that the central bank uses in making policy decisions. Let us call the premise that the\ncentral bank has no significant information advantage over the private sector the assumption of\nsymmetric\ninformation.\nIf the conditions of systematic policymaking, financial-market efficiency, and symmetric information all\nheld, then one might hope that the economy would converge to a rational expectations equilibrium, in\nwhich participants in financial markets would need only to analyze incoming, publicly available\neconomic data to make efficient forecasts of future Federal Reserve actions.1 In this benchmark case,\nthere would be no marginal benefit to central bank communication, beyond whatever was necessary to\nsupport this equilibrium in the first place.\nOf course, to describe this idealized benchmark case is to recognize that it is at best an approximate\nnot\ndescription of the economy in which we live. In practice, financial-market participants generally do\nhave as much information as monetary policymakers do about a number of key inputs to policymaking,\nincluding the policymakers' own objectives, their (possibly implicit) model of the economy and the\nmonetary transmission mechanism, their assessment of the economic situation (including both\nasymmetry of\nforecasts and the risks to the forecast), and their policy strategy. To the extent that this\ninformation between the central bank and the financial markets is quantitatively important - and I will\npresent some evidence on this point shortly - financial markets will not price bonds and other assets\nefficiently (relative to the information possessed by the central bank), and scope may exist for central\nbank communication to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy and the overall performance of\nthe economy.\nA skeptic might argue that noise and other sources of pricing inefficiency pervade the financial\nmarkets, so that improving the predictability of monetary policy is of limited importance in practice,\nexcept perhaps to a few brokers and traders. To the contrary, there is good reason to believe that\ninformation asymmetries between the central bank and financial markets may matter a great deal for\neconomic welfare. A theoretical basis for this view is provided by the lively recent literature on adaptive\nlearning and monetary policy. This work has shown that, when the public does not know but instead\nmust estimate the central bank's reaction function and other economic relationships using observed\ndata, we have no guarantee that the economy will converge - even in infinite time - to the optimal\nitself\nrational expectations equilibrium.2 In general, the problem is that the public's learning process\naffects the behavior of the economy - for example, as when expectational errors by bond traders affect\ninterest rates and thus a wide range of economic decisions. The feedback effect of learning on the\neconomy, this literature has shown, can in principle lead to unstable or indeterminate outcomes. More\ngenerally, the dynamic behavior of an economy with asymmetric information and learning may be\nradically different from the behavior of the same economy in the optimal rational expectations\nequilibrium.\nA particularly interesting analysis of the implications of learning for monetary policy and central bank\ncommunication has been provided in a series of papers by Athanasios Orphanides and\nJohn C. Williams (2003a, 2003b). Orphanides and Williams study model economies in which the\npublic is assumed to know the general nature of the economy's underlying structure but not the\nprecise quantitative magnitudes describing that structure. Specifically, these authors consider a model\nin which the public is assumed to know the form of the equation describing the dynamic behavior of\ninflation but not the parameters of that equation, which depend on the (unobserved by the public)\nobjectives and preferences of the central bank. Orphanides and Williams assume that, to learn the\nparameters of the process that generates inflation, people must apply standard statistical methods to\nobserved data on inflation and other macroeconomic variables.\nObviously, in assuming that people know the true economic structure with certainty, and that they infer\nthe underlying parameters of that structure using formal statistical methods, Orphanides and Williams\nand others in this literature are attributing much greater knowledge and sophistication to the public\nthan exist in the real world. Nevertheless, the behavior of their model economies with learning can be\nquite different from that of the rational expectations analogue, in which the public is assumed to have\nfull and symmetric information. For example, these authors show that the economy with learning is\nprone to episodes of stagflation, or combinations of high inflation and low output. The logic is as\nfollows: When people are learning about the inflation process, an increase in inflation that would be\nonly temporary and would leave expectations unaffected in a rational expectations world, may instead\nlead the public to infer that the long-run average rate of inflation is higher than previously thought. The\nrise in the public's inflation expectations affects wage- and price-setting and other economic decisions\nand thus raises actual inflation. In a vicious cycle, the higher rate of realized inflation further increases\ninflation expectations, forcing the central bank to tighten policy. The result is inflation that is\nunnecessarily high and output that is unnecessarily low.\nSeveral insights come from this and other contributions to the literature on adaptive learning in\nmacroeconomics. First, the fact that the public must learn about underlying economic relationships\nchanges the nature of the optimal monetary policy. In general, with learning, the central bank's optimal\npolicy involves exerting a tighter control on inflation than it might otherwise exert, to avoid the\npossibility that inflation expectations will drift randomly higher (or lower). Thus, this approach\nformalizes the idea that a central bank should work actively to \"anchor\" inflation expectations within a\nnarrow range. Second, efficient policy in this world requires that policymakers pay attention to\ninformation (for example, from surveys) about the public's expectations of inflation and other variables;\nif these appear not to be converging toward the desired levels, then a policy response may be\nwarranted.3 Finally, and most important for my purpose today, communication by the central bank may\nplay a key role in helping improve economic performance. For example, in the models analyzed by\nOrphanides and Williams, the provision of information by the central bank about its long-run inflation\nobjective or its economic forecasts generally leads to more favorable policy tradeoffs and better\neconomic outcomes.\nThe work on adaptive learning by Orphanides and Williams and others is largely theoretical, but in my\nview it is highly relevant to understanding modern U.S. monetary history. A leading example is the\nstagflationary period of the 1970s, in which astute observers recognized that high and unstable public\nexpectations of inflation, themselves generated by poor macroeconomic policies that allowed inflation\nto get out of control, greatly increased the complexity and cost of restoring stability.4 More recently,\nMarvin Goodfriend (1993) has identified several instances of what he calls \"inflation scares,\"\napparently autonomous increases in inflation expectations that raised long-term bond yields and\nforced a tightening of monetary policy that could have been avoided if expectations had been better\nanchored. The view that adaptive learning and asymmetric information are crucial to understanding\nrecent monetary history is apparently shared by the developers of the Federal Reserve's primary\neconometric model, the FRBUS model, which relies heavily on these assumptions (Brayton et al.,\n1997). Simulations of that model suggest both that adaptive learning is needed to explain the\nobserved responses of the financial market and the economy to monetary policy actions, and that\nasymmetric information and adaptive learning lead systematically to inferior macroeconomic\noutcomes, as implied by the work of Orphanides and Williams and others.\nOf course, the situation in the United States is much better today than in the 1970s; both inflation and\ninflation expectations are much more stable, and better economic outcomes have been the result. But\nis there still scope for improvement? I will present some evidence to suggest that there is and then\nconclude by discussing how communications policies could help anchor and stabilize the system more\nfirmly.\nEvidence on the effectiveness of Fed communication\nIn the past decade, the Federal Reserve has taken a number of significant steps toward increased\ntransparency, including announcing decisions about the federal funds rate promptly after FOMC\nmeetings, indicating first a policy \"bias\" and then a \"balance of risks\" assessment in post-meeting\nstatements, and making the minutes of policy meetings publicly available (with a lag of about eight\nweeks). Members of the FOMC have also made greater use of vehicles such as testimony and\nspeeches to convey their assessments of the economy and their policy inclinations to the public. How\neffective have these efforts been?\nI earlier distinguished between short-run and long-run predictability of policy. Fairly strong evidence\nsupports the conclusion that the short-run predictability of policy has increased in recent years. For\nexample, Joe Lange, Brian Sack, and William Whitesell (2003) have shown that, since the late 1980s\nand early 1990s, monetary policy actions over short horizons have been predicted increasingly well by\nfinancial instruments such as three- and six-month Treasury bills and federal funds futures contracts.\nThese authors attribute at least part of this improvement to greater transparency on the part of the\nFederal Reserve. Poole, Rasche, and Thornton (2002) reach a similar conclusion.5\nHowever, the more important question is whether the Federal Reserve has improved the ability of the\npublic to forecast its policies at long horizons. Long-horizon forecastability of policy has a number of\ndimensions, of course. One that has received particular attention in the literature, and which is closely\nrelated to theoretical models that assume adaptive learning, is the question of whether the public is\nable to infer the Federal Reserve's implicit long-run inflation objective.6 Uncertainty about this objective\nbears directly on the market's ability to price long-term assets, as well as on the capacity of wage- and\nprice-setters to strike efficient long-term agreements and of firms and households to make long-term\neconomic plans.\nVarious types of evidence bear on this question. For example, some recent research has considered\nexpectations of inflation and other variables as measured by surveys. One clear finding is that, as\ninflation has come under control and has stabilized in the United States in recent years, long-term\ninflation expectations have stabilized as well, suggesting reduced uncertainty about the Fed's ultimate\ninflation objective. For example, a cross-country study of inflation expectations by staff of the\nEuropean Central Bank found that, since 1990, both the average level of expected inflation and the\nvolatility of reported expectations of inflation in the United States have declined, the latter quite\nsignificantly (especially since 1999).7 However, as an aside, it is interesting that both surveys and the\ninflation compensation priced into the yields on indexed bonds suggest that today long-term inflation\nexpectations in the United States remain in the vicinity of 2-1/2 to 3 percent, above the range of\ninflation that many observers believe to represent the FOMC's implicit target. Possibly, this\nobservation indicates an ongoing process of adaptive learning.\nA subtler issue is the degree to which inflation expectations in the United States are anchored.\nSpecifically, to what extent would inflation expectations rise if actual inflation increased for some\nreason? To address this question, Andrew Levin, Fabio Natalucci, and Jeremy Piger (2003) examined\nU.S. private-sector forecasts of inflation since 1994. They found that medium- and long-term forecasts\nof inflation in the United States are strongly correlated with three-year moving average of lagged\ninflation, a finding that suggests that inflation expectations are not entirely anchored but are instead\nsubject to adaptive learning. As a supporting piece of evidence, Levin, Natalucci, and Piger show that,\ncompared to other industrial countries, shocks to inflation tend to be relatively persistent in the United\nStates, an implication of models with adaptive learning.8\nBond markets provide fertile ground in which to search for evidence on the importance of adaptive\nlearning and the degree to which expectations are well anchored. For example, Refet Gurkaynak,\nBrian Sack, and Eric Swanson (2003) show that distant forward rates (e.g., the implied one-year\nforward rate ten years in the future) move significantly in response to the unexpected components of\nboth monetary policy decisions and a number of macroeconomic data releases. Because they do not\nfind the same result for inflation-indexed securities (that is, real forward rates do not respond to policy\nor data surprises), they conclude that long-term expectations of inflation must not be tightly anchored\nin the United States. Kevin Kliesen and Frank Schmid (2003) support these findings by showing\ndirectly that ten-year inflation expectations, as derived from inflation-indexed bonds, respond\nsignificantly to policy surprises as well as to the unexpected components of macroeconomic data\nreleases.9\nInteresting work by Sharon Kozicki and Peter Tinsley (2001a, 2001b) bears directly on the importance\nof asymmetric information and learning in financial markets. Kozicki and Tinsley incorporate alternative\nspecifications of the evolution of inflation expectations in a standard model of the term structure (see\nCampbell, Lo and MacKinlay, 1997). Kozicki and Tinsley show that by far the best fit is obtained when\ninflation expectations are modeled as evolving by adaptive learning, in which inflation expectations\nadjust slowly to actual inflation. When inflation expectations are modeled this way, and only when they\nare modeled this way, the expectations theory of the term structure performs well and estimated term\npremiums are relatively small. In related research, Glenn Rudebusch and Tao Wu (2003) show\nempirically that a two-factor model of the term structure can be closely linked to monetary policy\nfundamentals, but only on the assumption that the medium-term inflation expectations held by market\nparticipants are time-varying. All the cited findings apply to recent data, as well to earlier observations.\nThe evidence for asymmetric information and adaptive learning, at least in regard to the Fed's inflation\nobjective, thus seems quite strong.\nImplications for central bank communication\nSo far I have discussed why central bank communication is important for financial market efficiency\nand good macroeconomic performance, and I have presented a few pieces of evidence that suggest\nthat asymmetry of information between the Federal Reserve and the public may be an important\nphenomenon. What implications does all this have for the communication policies of the Fed?\nIn an ideal world, the Federal Reserve would release to the public a complete specification of its policy\nrule, relating the FOMC's target for the federal funds rate to current and expected economic\nconditions, as well as its economic models, data, and forecasts. Using this information,\nfinancial-market participants would be able to forecast future values of the policy rate and efficiently\nprice long-term bonds and other assets. Unfortunately, as stressed by Poole (2003) as well as by\nChairman Greenspan (2003) in his talk at the most recent Jackson Hole conference, specifying a\ncomplete and explicit policy rule, from which the central bank would never deviate under any\ncircumstances, is impractical. The problem is that the number of contingencies to which policy might\nrespond is effectively infinite (and, indeed, many are unforeseeable).\nWhile specifying a complete policy rule is infeasible, however, there is much that a central bank can do\n- both by its actions and its words - to improve the ability of financial markets to predict monetary\npolicy actions. With respect to actions, the central bank should behave in as systematic and as\nunderstandable a way as possible, given the macroeconomic and financial environment. That is,\nalthough monetary policy cannot be made by a mechanical rule, policy can and should have \"rule-like\"\nfeatures. Obviously, the more systematic and the more consistent with a few basic principles the\nconduct of monetary policy becomes, the easier it will be for the public to understand and predict the\nFed's behavior.10 However, because the world is complex and ever changing, policy actions alone,\nwithout explanation, will never be enough to provide the public with the information it needs to predict\npolicy actions. Words are also necessary.\nWhat then should the Fed talk about? In general, the research I have discussed today suggests that\nthe central bank should do what it can to make information symmetric, providing the public to the\nextent possible with the same information that the FOMC uses in making its decisions.11 More\nspecifically, the strongest implication of the adaptive learning literature is that the Fed should be as\nexplicit as possible about its policy objectives. Without clear information about policy objectives, the\npublic's problem of predicting future monetary policy actions becomes extremely difficult. For example,\nwithout this information, it would be hard for the public to know whether an unexpected policy move\nsignals a change in the policymakers' objectives, a change in their economic outlook, or both. As also\nsuggested by the adaptive learning literature, a potential advantage of having an explicit objective for\ninflation in particular is that it may help to anchor the public's expectations.12\nBesides its policy objectives, the central bank can make other useful information available to the\npublic, including its economic forecasts, its assessment of the economic risks, and (if possible) the\nmodels or analytical frameworks that underlie its diagnosis of the economy. The Federal Reserve\ncurrently provides information on each of these elements. For example, the so-called \"central\ntendency\" forecasts of the FOMC are released twice a year, as part of the Chairman's semiannual\ntestimony before Congress; the statements following FOMC meetings provide some assessment of\nthe perceived risks to the forecast; and the active research programs conducted at the Board and the\nReserve banks, including publications and conferences, provide observers insights into the underlying\nanalytical frameworks that inform monetary policymaking.\nWe should continue to seek improvement in each of these areas. For example, FOMC forecasts might\nbe released more frequently and for a longer horizon. Additional variables could be forecasted, notably\ncore inflation, a key factor in FOMC policy decisions. More controversially, the FOMC might consider\nforecasting future values of the short-term interest rate, as is currently done by the Reserve Bank of\nNew Zealand. The difficulty would be to make clear that an interest-rate forecast is not the same as a\npolicy commitment. The use of \"fan charts\" to indicate the range of uncertainty would be helpful in this\nregard; and indeed, providing more information about the range of uncertainty for all FOMC forecasts\nwould be a useful innovation.\nIn my talk today I have often adopted the common convention of speaking of the central bank as if it\nwere a single actor. In reality, policymaking at most central banks is done by a committee. In the\nUnited States, nineteen people (twelve of whom get to vote at any given meeting) have seats at the\nFOMC table. The diversity of views and opinions likely to exist among the members of a large\ncommittee create further challenges for effective communication. However, vehicles do exist to help\nconvey the breadth of opinion on the Committee. For example, the minutes of FOMC meetings\ndescribe the range of viewpoints and many of the key considerations underlying policy decisions. In\nmy view, releasing these minutes more promptly than is now done would provide useful and more\ntimely information for the public. Although at times it feels cacophonous, the willingness of FOMC\nmembers to present their individual perspectives in speeches and other public forums provides the\npublic with useful information about the diversity of views and the balance of opinion on the\nCommittee.\nOther possibilities for improved transparency may exist. Importantly, as we think about these, we\nshould not simply take the view that more information is always better. Indeed, irrelevant or badly\ncommunicated information may create more noise than signal; and some types of information\nprovision - an extreme example would be televising FOMC meetings - risk compromising the integrity\nand quality of the policymaking process itself. Rather, the key question should be whether the\nadditional information will improve the public's understanding of the Fed's objectives, economic\nassessments, and analytical framework, thus allowing them to make better inferences about how\nmonetary policy is likely to respond to future developments in the economy. Communication that\nmeets this criterion will lead to better monetary policy and better economic performance.",

         "Ben S Bernanke: Conducting monetary policy at very low short-term interest\nrates\nLecture by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, and Mr Vincent R Reinhart, Director, Division of Monetary Affairs of the Board of Governors of\nthe US Federal Reserve System1, at the International Center for Monetary and Banking Studies,\nGeneva, 14 January 2004. Paper also presented at the meetings of the American Economic\nAssociation, San Diego, 3 January 2004.\nThe references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.\n* * *\nCan monetary policy committees, accustomed to describing their plans and actions in terms of the\nlevel of a short-term nominal interest rate, find effective means of conducting and communicating their\npolicies when that rate is zero or close to zero? The very low levels of interest rates in Japan,\nSwitzerland, and the United States in recent years have stimulated much interesting research on this\nquestion, and some has been applied in the field. Moreover, their minds concentrated by the possibility\nof having the policy rate pinned at zero, central bankers have responded flexibly, making changes in\ntheir operating procedures and communications strategies. Our purpose in this paper is to give a brief\nprogress report and overview of current thinking on the conduct of monetary policy when short-term\ninterest rates are very low or even zero.2\nMonetary policy works for the most part through financial markets. Central bank actions are designed\nin the first instance to influence asset prices and yields, which in turn affect economic decisions and\nthus the evolution of the economy. When the short-term policy rate is at or near zero, the conventional\nmeans of effecting monetary ease--lowering the target for the policy rate--is no longer feasible, but\nmonetary policy is not impotent. In this paper we will discuss three alternative (but potentially\ncomplementary) monetary strategies for stimulating the economy that do not involve changing the\ncurrent value of the policy rate. Specifically, these alternatives involve (1) providing assurance to\nfinancial investors that short rates will be lower in the future than they currently expect, (2) changing\nthe relative supplies of securities (such as Treasury notes and bonds) in the marketplace by shifting\nthe composition of the central bank's balance sheet, and (3) increasing the size of the central bank's\nbalance sheet beyond the level needed to set the short-term policy rate at zero (\"quantitative easing\").\nIn the final section, we briefly discuss the macroeconomic costs and benefits of very low interest rates,\nan issue that bears on the question of whether the central bank should take the policy rate all the way\nto zero before undertaking some of the alternatives we describe.\nI. Shaping Interest-Rate Expectations\nThe pricing of long-lived assets, such as long-term bonds and equities, depends on the entire\nexpected future path of short-term interest rates as well as on the current short-term rate. Prices and\nyields of long-lived assets are important determinants of economic behavior because they affect\nincentives to spend, save, and invest. Thus, a central bank may hope to affect financial markets and\neconomic activity by influencing financial market participants' expectations of future short-term rates.\nImportant recent research has examined this potential channel of influence in fully articulated models\nbased on optimizing behavior; see Michael Woodford (2003, chapter 6), Lars Svensson (2001), and\nGauti Eggertson and Woodford (2003). This literature suggests that, even with the overnight nominal\ninterest rate at zero, a central bank can impart additional stimulus by offering some form of\ncommitment to the public to keep the short rate low for a longer period than previously expected. This\ncommitment, if credible, should lower yields throughout the term structure and support other asset\nprices.\nIn principle, the central bank's policy commitment could take either of two forms: unconditional and\nconditional. An unconditional commitment is a pledge by the central bank to hold short-term rates at a\nlow level for a fixed period of calendar time. In this case, additional easing would take the form of\nlengthening the period of policy commitment. However, given the many shocks that the economy is\nheir to, as well as other imponderables that affect the outlook, a policymaking committee might\nunderstandably be reluctant to tie its hands by making an unconditional promise, no matter how\nnuanced, about policy actions far into the future. An alternative strategy is to make a conditional policy\ncommitment, one that links the duration of promised policies not to the calendar but to the evolution of\neconomic conditions. For example, policy ease could be promised until the committee observes\nsustained economic growth, substantial progress in trimming economic slack, or a period of inflation\nabove a specified floor.\nIn practice, central banks appear to appreciate the importance of influencing market expectations\nabout future policy. For example, in May 2001, with its policy rate virtually at zero, the Bank of Japan\npromised that it would keep its policy rate at zero for as long as the economy experienced deflation--a\nconditional policy commitment. More recently, the Bank of Japan has been more explicit about the\nconditions under which it would begin to raise rates; for example, it has been specified that a change\nfrom deflation to inflation that is perceived to be temporary will not provoke a tightening.3 In the United\nStates, the August 2003 statement of the Federal Open Market Committee that \"policy\naccommodation can be maintained for a considerable period\" is another example of commitment. The\nclose association of this statement with the Committee's expressed concerns about \"unwelcome\ndisinflation\" implied that this commitment was conditioned on the assessment of the economy. The\nconditional nature of the commitment was sharpened in the Committee's December statement, which\nexplicitly linked continuing policy accommodation to the low level of inflation and the slack in resource\nuse.4 More generally, in recent years central banks have devoted enormous effort to improving their\ncommunications and transparency; a major benefit of such efforts should be a greater ability to align\nmarket expectations of policy with the policymaking committee's own intentions.\nOf course, policy commitments can influence future expectations only to the extent that they are\ncredible. Various devices might be employed to enhance credibility; for example, the central bank can\nmake securities purchases or issue financial options that make it quite costly, in financial terms, to\nrenege on its commitments (Clouse et al., 2003). An objection to this strategy is that it is not entirely\nclear why a central bank, which has the power to print money, should be overly concerned about its\nfinancial gains and losses. Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) point out that a government can more\ncredibly promise to carry out policies that raise prices when (1) the government debt is large and not\nindexed to inflation and (2) the central bank values the reduction in fiscal burden that reflationary\npolicies will bring (for example, because it may reduce the future level of distortionary taxation).\nUltimately, however, the central bank's best strategy for building credibility is to ensure that its deeds\nmatch its words, thereby building trust in its pronouncements. The requirement that deeds match\nwords has the consequence that the shaping of market expectations is not an independent instrument\nof policy in the long run.\nII. Altering the Composition of the Central Bank's Balance Sheet\nCentral banks typically hold a variety of assets, and the composition of assets on the central bank's\nbalance sheet offers another potential lever for monetary policy. For example, the Federal Reserve\nparticipates in all segments of the Treasury market, with most of its current asset holdings of about\n$670 billion distributed among Treasury securities with maturities ranging from four weeks to thirty\nyears. Over the past fifty years, the average maturity of the Federal Reserve System's holdings of\nTreasury debt has varied considerably within a range from one to four years. As an important\nparticipant in the Treasury market, the Federal Reserve might be able to influence term premiums, and\nthus overall yields, by shifting the composition of its holdings, say from shorter- to longer-dated\nsecurities. In simple terms, if the liquidity or risk characteristics of securities differ, so that investors do\nnot treat all securities as perfect substitutes, then changes in relative demands by a large purchaser\nhave the potential to alter relative security prices. (The same logic might lead the central bank to\nconsider purchasing assets other than Treasury securities, such as corporate bonds or stocks or\nforeign government bonds. The Federal Reserve is currently authorized to purchase some foreign\ngovernment bonds but not most private-sector assets, such as corporate bonds or stocks.)\nPerhaps the most extreme example of a policy keyed to the composition of the central bank's balance\nsheet is an announced ceiling on some longer-term yield below the prevailing rate. This policy entails\n(in principle) an unlimited commitment to purchase the targeted security at the announced price. (To\nkeep the overall size of its balance sheet unchanged, the central bank would have to sell other\nsecurities in an amount equal to the purchases of the targeted security.) Obviously, such a policy\nwould signal strong dissatisfaction on the part of the policymaking committee with current market\nexpectations of future policy rates.\nWhether policies based on manipulating the composition of the central bank balance sheet can be\neffective is a contentious issue. The limited empirical evidence generally suggests that the degree of\nimperfect substitutability within broad asset classes, such as Treasury securities, is not great, so that\nchanges in relative supplies within the range of U.S. experience are unlikely to have a major impact on\nrisk premiums or term premiums (Reinhart and Sack, 2001). If this view is correct, then attempts to\nenforce a floor on the prices of long-dated Treasury securities (for example) could be effective only if\nthe target prices were broadly consistent with investor expectations of future values of the policy rate.\nIf investors doubted that rates would be kept low, the central bank would end up owning all or most of\nthose securities. Moreover, even if large purchases of, say, a long-dated Treasury security were able\nto affect the yield on that security, the policy may not have significant economic effects if the targeted\nsecurity became \"disconnected\" from the rest of the term structure and from private rates, such as\nmortgage rates.\nYet another complication affecting this type of policy is that the central bank's actions would have to be\ncoordinated with the central government's finance department to ensure that changes in\ndebtmanagement policies do not offset the attempts of the central bank to affect the relative supplies of\nsecurities. According to James Tobin, the Federal Reserve's failure to coordinate adequately with the\nTreasury was the undoing of \"Operation Twist\" in 1963 (Tobin, 1973, pp. 32-33).\nDespite these objections, we should not fail to note that policies based on changing the composition of\nthe central bank's balance sheet have been tried in the United States. From 1942 to 1951, the Federal\nReserve enforced rate ceilings at two and sometimes three points on the Treasury yield curve. This\nobjective was accomplished with only moderate increases in the Federal Reserve's overall holdings of\nTreasury securities, relative to net debt outstanding; moreover, there is little evidence that the targeted\nyields became \"disconnected\" from other public or private yields. The episode is an intriguing one, but\nunfortunately the implications for current policy are not entirely straightforward. We know that, by\n1946, the Federal Reserve System owned almost nine-tenths of the (relatively small) stock of Treasury\nbills, suggesting that at the short end, the ceiling on the bill rate was a binding constraint. In contrast,\nthe Federal Reserve's relative holdings of longer-dated Treasury notes and bonds fell over the period,\nalthough the rate ceilings at these longer maturities were not breached until inflation pressures led to\nthe Fed-Treasury Accord and the abandonment of the pegging policy in 1951. The conventional\ninterpretation is that long-run policy expectations must have been consistent with the ceilings at the\nmore distant points on the yield curve. Less clear is the extent to which the pegging policy itself\ninfluenced those policy expectations.\nProbably the safest conclusion about policies based on changing the composition of the central bank's\nbalance sheet is that they should be used only to supplement other policies, such as an attempt (for\nexample, through a policy commitment) to influence expectations of future short rates. This combined\napproach allows the central bank to enjoy whatever benefits arise from changing the relative supplies\nof outstanding securities without risking the problems that may arise if the yields desired by the central\nbank are inconsistent with market expectations.\nIII. Expanding the Size of the Central Bank's Balance Sheet\nBesides changing the composition of its balance sheet, the central bank can also alter policy by\nchanging the size of its balance sheet; that is, by buying or selling securities to affect the overall\nsupply of reserves and the money stock. Of course, this strategy represents the conventional means\nof conducting monetary policy, as described in many textbooks. These days, most central banks\nchoose to calibrate the degree of policy ease or tightness by targeting the price of reserves--in the\ncase of the Federal Reserve, the overnight federal funds rate. However, nothing prevents a central\nbank from switching its focus from the price of reserves to the quantity or growth of reserves. When\nstated in terms of quantities, it becomes apparent that even if the price of reserves (the federal funds\nrate) becomes pinned at zero, the central bank can still expand the quantity of reserves. That is,\nreserves can be increased beyond the level required to hold the overnight rate at zero--a policy\nsometimes referred to as \"quantitative easing.\" Some evidence exists that quantitative easing can\nstimulate the economy even when interest rates are near zero; see, for example, Christina Romer's\n(1992) discussion of the effects of increases in the money supply during the Great Depression in the\nUnited States.\nQuantitative easing may affect the economy through several possible channels. One potential channel\nis based on the premise that money is an imperfect substitute for other financial assets (in contrast to\nthe view discussed in the previous section that emphasizes the imperfect substitutability of various\nnonmoney assets). If this premise holds, then large increases in the money supply will lead investors\nto seek to rebalance their portfolios, raising prices and reducing yields on alternative, non-money\nassets. Lower yields on long-term assets will in turn stimulate economic activity. The possibility that\nmonetary policy works through portfolio substitution effects, even in normal times, has a long\nintellectual history, having been espoused by both Keynesians (Tobin, 1969) and monetarists\n(Brunner and Meltzer, 1973). Recently, Javier Andres, J. David Lopez-Salido, and Edward Nelson\n(2003) have shown how these effects might work in a general equilibrium model with optimizing\nagents. The practical importance of these effects remains an open question, however.\nQuantitative easing may also work by altering expectations of the future path of policy rates. For\nexample, suppose that the central bank commits itself to keeping reserves at a high level, well above\nthat needed to ensure a zero short-term interest rate, until certain economic conditions obtain.\nTheoretically, this action is equivalent to a commitment to keep interest rates at zero until the\neconomic conditions are met, a type of policy we have already discussed. However, the act of setting\nand meeting a high reserves target is more visible, and hence may be more credible, than a purely\nverbal promise about future short-term interest rates. Moreover, this means of committing to a zero\ninterest rate will also achieve any benefits of quantitative easing that may be felt through\nnonexpectational channels.\nLastly, quantitative easing that is sufficiently aggressive and that is perceived to be long-lived may\nhave expansionary fiscal effects. So long as market participants expect a positive short-term interest\nrate at some date in the future, the existence of government debt implies a current or future tax liability\nfor the public. In expanding its balance sheet by open-market purchases, the central bank replaces\npublic holdings of interest-bearing government debt with non-interest-bearing currency or reserves. If\nthe open-market operation is not expected to be reversed too quickly, this exchange reduces the\npresent and future interest costs of the government and the tax burden on the public. (Effectively, this\nprocess replaces a direct tax, say on labor, with the inflation tax.) Auerbach and Obstfeld (2003) have\nanalyzed the fiscal and expectational effects of a permanent increase in the money supply along these\nlines. Note that the expectational and fiscal channels of quantitative easing, though not the portfolio\nsubstitution channel, require the central bank to make a credible commitment to not reverse its\nopenmarket operations, at least until certain conditions are met. Thus, this approach also poses\ncommunication challenges for monetary policy makers.\nJapan once again provides the most recent case study. In the past two years, current account\nbalances held by commercial banks at the Bank of Japan have increased about five-fold, and the\nmonetary base has risen to almost 30 percent of nominal GDP. While deflation appears to have eased\nin Japan recently, it is difficult to know how much of the improvement is due to monetary policy, and, of\nthe part due to monetary policy, how much is due to the zero-interest-rate policy and how much to\nquantitative easing. The experience of the United States with quantitative policies is limited to the\nperiod 1979 to 1982, when the Federal Reserve targeted nonborrowed reserves. Of course, nominal\ninterest rates were not close to zero at that time. The U.S. experience does suggest, however, that the\ndemand for reserves may be sufficiently erratic that the effects of quantitative policies may be\nintrinsically hard to calibrate.\nIV. Sequencing and the \"Costs\" of Low Interest Rates\nThe forms of monetary stimulus described above can be used once the overnight rate has already\nbeen driven to zero or as a way of driving the overnight rate to zero. However, a central bank might\nchoose to rely on these alternative policies while maintaining the overnight rate somewhat above zero.\nFor example, monetary policy makers might attempt to influence market expectations of future short\nrates as an alternative to changing the current setting of the overnight rate. Another possibility is to try\nto affect term premiums, expectations of future rates, or both, by changing the composition of\nsecurities held by the central bank. (Unlimited expansion of the total volume of securities held by the\ncentral bank is not compatible, of course, with a positive overnight rate.) The appropriate sequencing\nof policy actions depends on the perceived costs associated with very low or zero overnight interest\nrates, as well as on operational considerations and estimates of the likely effects of alternative\ncombinations of policies on the economy.\nWhat costs are imposed on society by very low short-term interest rates? Observers have pointed out\nthat rates on financial instruments typically priced below the overnight rate, such as liquid deposits,\nshares in money market mutual funds, and collateralized borrowings in the \"repo\" market, would be\nsqueezed toward zero as the policy rate fell, prompting investors to seek alternatives. Short-term\ndislocations might result, for example, if funds flowed in large amounts from money market mutual\nfunds into bank deposits. In that case, some commercial paper issuers who have traditionally relied on\nmoney market mutual funds for financing would have to seek out new sources, while banks would\nneed to find productive uses for the deposit inflows and perhaps face changes in regulatory capital\nrequirements. In addition, liquidity in some markets might be affected; for example, the incentive for\nreserve managers to trade federal funds diminishes as the overnight rate falls, probably thinning\nbrokering in that market.\nIn thinking about the costs associated with a low overnight rate, one should bear in mind the message\nof Milton Friedman's classic essay on the optimal quantity of money (Friedman, 1969). Friedman\nargued that an overnight interest rate of zero is optimal, because a zero opportunity cost of liquidity\neliminates the socially wasteful use of resources to economize on money balances. From this\nperspective, the costs of low short-term interest rates can be seen largely as adjustment costs, arising\nfrom the unwinding of schemes designed to make holding transactions balances less burdensome.\nThese costs are real but are also largely transitory and have limited sectoral impact. Moreover, to the\nextent that the affected institutions have economic functions other than helping clients economize on\nmoney balances (for example, if some money market mutual funds have a comparative advantage in\nlending to commercial paper issuers), there is scope for repricing that will allow these services to\ncontinue to be offered. Thus there seems to be little reason for central banks to avoid bringing the\npolicy rate close to zero if the economic situation warranted.\nA quite different argument for engaging in alternative monetary policies before lowering the overnight\nrate all the way to zero is that the public might interpret a zero instrument rate as evidence that the\ncentral bank has \"run out of ammunition.\" That is, low rates risk fostering the misimpression that\nmonetary policy is ineffective. As we have stressed, that would indeed be a misimpression, as the\ncentral bank has means of providing monetary stimulus other than the conventional measure of\nlowering the overnight nominal interest rate. However, it is also true that the considerable uncertainty\nthat surrounds the use of these alternative measures does make the calibration of policy actions more\ndifficult. Moreover, given the important role for expectations in making many of these policies work, the\ncommunications challenges would be considerable. Given these risks, policymakers are well advised\nto act preemptively and aggressively to avoid facing the complications raised by the zero lower bound.",

         "Alan Greenspan: Risk and uncertainty in monetary policy\nRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the meetings of the American Economic Association, San Diego, 3 January 2004.\n* * *\nThis morning I plan to sketch the key developments of the past decade and a half of monetary policy\nin the United States from the perspective of someone who has been in the policy trenches. I will offer\nsome conclusions about what I believe has been learned thus far, though I suspect, as is so often the\ncase, the passing of time, further study, and reflection will deepen our understanding of these\ndevelopments. This is a personal statement; I am not speaking for my current colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the many others with whom I have served over these\nmany years.1\n* * *\nThe tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve in 1979, then led by my predecessor\nPaul Volcker, ultimately broke the back of price acceleration in the United States, ushering in a\ntwo-decade long decline in inflation that eventually brought us to the current state of price stability.\nThe fall in inflation over this period has been global in scope, and arguably beyond the expectations of\neven the most optimistic inflation fighters. I have little doubt that an unrelenting focus of monetary\npolicy on achieving price stability has been the principal contributor to disinflation. Indeed, the notion,\nadvanced by Milton Friedman more than thirty years ago, that inflation is everywhere and always a\nmonetary phenomenon is no longer a controversial proposition in the profession. But the size and\ngeographic extent of the decline in inflation raises the question of whether other forces have been at\nwork as well.\nI am increasingly of the view that, at a minimum, monetary policy in the last two decades has been\noperating in an environment particularly conducive to the pursuit of price stability. The principal\nfeatures of this environment included (1) increased political support for stable prices, which was the\nconsequence of, and reaction to, the unprecedented peacetime inflation in the 1970s,\n(2) globalization, which unleashed powerful new forces of competition, and (3) an acceleration of\nproductivity, which at least for a time held down cost pressures.\nI believe we at the Fed, to our credit, did gradually come to recognize the structural economic changes\nthat we were living through and accordingly altered our understanding of the key parameters of the\neconomic system and our policy stance. The central banks of other industrialized countries have\ngrappled with many of the same issues.\nBut as we lived through it, there was much uncertainty about the evolving structure of the economy\nand about the influence of monetary policy. Despite those uncertainties, the trauma of the 1970s was\nstill so vivid throughout the 1980s that preventing a return to accelerating prices was the unvarying\nfocus of our efforts during those years.\nIn recognition of the lag in monetary policy's impact on economic activity, a preemptive response to\nthe potential for building inflationary pressures was made an important feature of policy. As a\nconsequence, this approach elevated forecasting to an even more prominent place in policy\ndeliberations.\n* * *\nAfter an almost uninterrupted stint of easing from the summer of 1984 through the spring of 1987, the\nFed again began to lean against increasing inflationary pressures, which were in part the indirect\nresult of rapidly rising stock prices. We had recognized the risk of an adverse reaction in a stock\nmarket that had recently experienced a steep run-up - indeed, we actively engaged in contingency\nplanning against that possibility.\nIn the event, the crash in October 1987 was far more traumatic than any of the possible scenarios we\nhad identified. Previous planning was only marginally useful in that episode. We operated essentially\nin a crisis mode, responding with an immediate and massive injection of liquidity to help stabilize\nhighly volatile financial markets. However, most of our stabilization efforts were directed at keeping the\npayments system functioning and markets open. The concern over the possible fallout on economic\nactivity from so sharp a stock price decline kept us easing into early 1988. But the economy weathered\nthat shock reasonably well, and our easing extended perhaps longer than hindsight has indicated was\nnecessary.\nThat period was followed by a preemptive tightening that brought the federal funds rate close to\n10 percent by early 1989. In the summer of that year, we sensed enough softening of activity to\nwarrant beginning a series of rate reductions. However, the weakening of demand already under way,\nsome pullback of credit by lenders, and the spike in oil prices associated with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait\nwere sufficient to produce a marked contraction of activity in the fall of 1990. But perhaps aided by our\npreemptive action, the recession was, to then, the mildest in postwar history.\nHowever, the recovery also was more modest than usual, in large measure because of the notable\nfinancial \"headwinds\" that confronted businesses. Those headwinds were primarily generated by the\nconstriction of credit in response to major losses at banks, associated with real-estate and foreign\nlending, coupled with a crisis in the savings and loan industry that had its origins in a serious maturity\nmismatch as interest rates rose. With their access to managed funds threatened and the quality of\ntheir loan portfolio - and hence their capital - uncertain, these depositories were most reluctant to lend.\nPolicy eased gradually but persistently to counter the effects of these developments, with the funds\nrate falling to 3 percent by September 1992, its lowest level since the early 1960s. The uptilt to the\nterm structure of interest rates in a generally low interest rate environment restored bank profitability\nand, eventually, bank capital. The credit crunch slowly lifted.\nBy early 1994, as the headwinds of financial restraint abated, it became clear that underlying price\npressures were again building. If we had left those pressures unchecked, we would have put at risk\nsome of the hard-won gains that had been achieved over the preceding decade and a half. So,\nstarting from a real federal funds rate that was close to zero, a preemptive tightening was initiated. The\nresulting rise in the funds rate of 300 basis points over twelve months apparently defused those\nnascent inflationary pressures.\nThough economic activity hesitated in early 1995, it soon steadied, confirming the achievement of a\nhistorically elusive soft landing. The success of that period set up two powerful expectations that were\nto influence developments over the subsequent decade. One was the expectation that inflation could\nbe controlled over the business cycle and that price stability was an achievable objective. The second\nexpectation, in part a consequence of more stable inflation, was that overall economic volatility had\nbeen reduced and would likely remain lower than it had previously.\nOf course, these new developments brought new challenges. In particular, the prospect that a\nnecessary cyclical adjustment was now behind us fostered increasing levels of optimism, which were\nmanifested in a fall in bond risk spreads and a rise in stock prices. The associated decline in the cost\nof equity capital further spurred already developing increases in capital investment and productivity\ngrowth, both of which broadened impressively in the latter part of the 1990s.\nThe rise in structural productivity growth was not obvious in the official data on gross product per hour\nworked until later in the decade, but precursors had emerged earlier. The pickup in new bookings and\norder backlogs for high-tech capital goods in 1993 seemed incongruous given the sluggish economic\nenvironment at the time. Plant managers apparently were reacting to what they perceived to be\nelevated prospective rates of return on the newer technologies, a judgment that was confirmed as\norders and profits continued to increase through 1994 and 1995. Moreover, even though hourly labor\ncompensation and profit margins were rising, prices were being contained, implying increasing growth\nin output per hour.2\nAs a consequence of the improving trend in structural productivity growth that was apparent from 1995\nforward, we at the Fed were able to be much more accommodative to the rise in economic growth\nthan our past experiences would have deemed prudent. We were motivated, in part, by the view that\nthe evident structural economic changes rendered suspect, at best, the prevailing notion in the early\n1990s of an elevated and reasonably stable NAIRU. Those views were reinforced as inflation\ncontinued to fall in the context of a declining unemployment rate that by 2000 had dipped below\n4 percent in the United States for the first time in three decades.\nNotions that prevailed for a time in the 1970s and early 1980s that even high single-digit inflation did\nnot measurably impede economic growth were gradually abandoned as the evidence of significant\nbenefits of low inflation became increasingly persuasive. Moreover, the variance of GDP growth\nmarkedly lessened as inflation tumbled from its double-digit high in the early 1980s. To preserve these\nbenefits, we engaged in our most recent preemptive tightening in early 1999 that brought the funds\nrate to 6-1/2 percent by May 2000.\nOur goal of price stability was achieved by most analysts' definition by mid-2003. Unstinting and\nlargely preemptive efforts over two decades had finally paid off. Throughout the period, a key objective\nhas been to ensure that our response to incipient changes in inflation was forceful enough. As John\nTaylor has emphasized, in the face of an incipient increase in inflation, nominal interest rates must\nmove up more than one-for-one.3\n* * *\nPerhaps the greatest irony of the past decade is that the gradually unfolding success against inflation\nmay well have contributed to the stock price bubble of the latter part of the 1990s.4 Looking back on\nthose years, it is evident that technology-driven increases in productivity growth imparted significant\nupward momentum to expectations of earnings growth and, accordingly, to stock prices.5 At the same\ntime, an environment of increasing macroeconomic stability reduced perceptions of risk. In any event,\nFed policymakers were confronted with forces that none of us had previously encountered. Aside from\nthe then-recent experience of Japan, only remote historical episodes gave us clues to the appropriate\nstance for policy under such conditions. The sharp rise in stock prices and their subsequent fall were,\nthus, an especial challenge to the Federal Reserve.\nIt is far from obvious that bubbles, even if identified early, can be preempted at lower cost than a\nsubstantial economic contraction and possible financial destabilization - the very outcomes we would\nbe seeking to avoid.\nIn fact, our experience over the past two decades suggests that a moderate monetary tightening that\ndeflates stock prices without substantial effect on economic activity has often been associated with\nincreases\nsubsequent in the level of stock prices.6 Arguably, markets that pass that type of stress test\nare presumed particularly resilient. The notion that a well-timed incremental tightening could have\n3\nSee, for example, \"A Half-Century of Changes in Monetary Policy,\" John B. Taylor, remarks delivered at the conference in\nhonor of Milton Friedman, November 8, 2002, pp 9-10, manuscript, Department of the Treasury.\n4\nIt is notable, that in the United States, surges in price-earnings ratios, a presumed essential characteristic of an equity price\nbubble, are not observed with elevated inflation expectations.\n5\nBut, as the Federal Reserve indicated in congressional testimony in July 1999, \"... productivity acceleration does not ensure\nthat equity prices are not overextended. There can be little doubt that if the nation's productivity growth has stepped up, the\nlevel of profits and their future potential would be elevated. That prospect has supported higher stock prices. The danger is\nthat in these circumstances, an unwarranted, perhaps euphoric, extension of recent developments can drive equity prices to\nlevels that are unsupportable even if risks in the future become relatively small. Such straying above fundamentals could\ncreate problems for our economy when the inevitable adjustment occurs.\" Testimony of Alan Greenspan before the\nCommittee on Banking and Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, July 22, 1999.\n6\nFor example, stock prices rose following the completion of the more than 300 basis point rise in the federal funds rate in the\ntwelve months ending in February 1989. And during the year beginning in February 1994, when the Federal Reserve again\nraised the federal funds target 300 basis points, stock prices initially flattened. But as soon as that round of tightening was\ncompleted, prices resumed their marked upward advance. From mid-1999 through May 2000, the federal funds rate was\nraised 150 basis points. However, equity price increases were largely undeterred during that period despite what now, in\nretrospect, was the exhausted tail of a bull market. Stock prices peaked in March 2000, but the market basically moved\nsideways until September of that year.\nSuch data suggest that nothing short of a sharp increase in short-term rates that engenders a significant economic\nretrenchment with all its attendant risks is sufficient to check a nascent bubble. Certainly, 300 basis points proved\ninadequate to even dent stock prices in 1994.\nBIS Review 1/2004\nbeen calibrated to prevent the late 1990s bubble while preserving economic stability is almost surely\nan illusion.7\nInstead of trying to contain a putative bubble by drastic actions with largely unpredictable\nconsequences, we chose, as we noted in our mid-1999 congressional testimony, to focus on policies\n\"to mitigate the fallout when it occurs and, hopefully, ease the transition to the next expansion.\"8\n* * *\nDuring 2001, in the aftermath of the bursting of the bubble and the acts of terrorism in September\n2001, the federal funds rate was lowered 4-3/4 percentage points. Subsequently, another 75 basis\npoints were pared, bringing the rate by June 2003 to its current 1 percent, the lowest level in 45 years.\nWe were able to be unusually aggressive in the initial stages of the recession of 2001 because both\ninflation and inflation expectations were low and stable. We thought we needed to be, and could be,\nforceful in 2002 and 2003 as well because, with demand weak, inflation risks had become two-sided\nfor the first time in forty years.\nThere appears to be enough evidence, at least tentatively, to conclude that our strategy of addressing\nthe bubble's consequences rather than the bubble itself has been successful. Despite the stock\nmarket plunge, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals, and wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, we\nexperienced an exceptionally mild recession - even milder than that of a decade earlier. As I discuss\nlater, much of the ability of the U.S. economy to absorb these sequences of shocks resulted from\nnotably improved structural flexibility. But highly aggressive monetary ease was doubtless also a\nsignificant contributor to stability.9\n* * *\nThe Federal Reserve's experiences over the past two decades make it clear that uncertainty is not just\na pervasive feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of that landscape.\nThe term \"uncertainty\" is meant here to encompass both \"Knightian uncertainty,\" in which the\nprobability distribution of outcomes is unknown, and \"risk,\" in which uncertainty of outcomes is\ndelimited by a known probability distribution. In practice, one is never quite sure what type of\nuncertainty one is dealing with in real time, and it may be best to think of a continuum ranging from\nwell-defined risks to the truly unknown.\nAs a consequence, the conduct of monetary policy in the United States has come to involve, at its\ncore, crucial elements of risk management. This conceptual framework emphasizes understanding as\nmuch as possible the many sources of risk and uncertainty that policymakers face, quantifying those\n7\nSome have asserted that the Federal Reserve can deflate a stock-price bubble - rather painlessly - by boosting margin\nrequirements. The evidence suggests otherwise. First, the amount of margin debt is small, having never amounted to more\nthan about 1-3/4 percent of the market value of equities; moreover, even this figure overstates the amount of margin debt\nused to purchase stock, as such debt also finances short sales of equity and transactions in non-equity securities. Second,\ninvestors need not rely on margin debt to take a leveraged position in equities. They can borrow from other sources to buy\nstock. Or, they can purchase options, which will affect stock prices given the linkages across markets.\nThus, not surprisingly, the preponderance of research suggests that changes in margins are not an effective tool for\nreducing stock market volatility. It is possible that margin requirements inhibit very small investors whose access to other\nforms of credit is limited. If so, the only effect of increasing margin requirements is to price out of the market the very small\ninvestor without addressing the broader issue of stock price bubbles.\nIf a change in margin requirements were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank would soon tighten monetary\npolicy enough to burst a bubble, then there might be the appearance of a causal effect. But it is the prospect of monetary\npolicy action, not the margin increase, that should be viewed as the trigger. In a similar manner, history tells us that\n\"jawboning\" asset markets will be ineffective unless backed by action.\n8\nOp. cit.\n9\nSome have argued that, as a consequence of the 1995-2000 speculative episode, long-term imbalances remain, having\nbeen only partly addressed since early 2001, the peak of the post-bubble business cycle. For example, large residues of\nhousehold and external debt are perceived as barriers to future growth. But in the past, imbalances that led to business\ncontractions were rarely fully reversed before the subsequent economic upturn began. Presumably they were fully reversed\nin later periods, or they continued to fester, but not by enough to halt economic growth.\nEven if imbalances still persist in our current environment, the business decline that began in March 2001 came to an end in\nNovember of that year, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. We experienced tepid recovery until the\nsecond half of last year, when GDP accelerated considerably. Hence, when the next recession arrives, as it inevitably will, it\nwill be a stretch to attribute it to speculative imbalances of many years earlier.\nBIS Review 1/2004\nrisks when possible, and assessing the costs associated with each of the risks. In essence, the risk\nmanagement approach to monetary policymaking is an application of Bayesian decisionmaking.\nThis framework also entails devising, in light of those risks, a strategy for policy directed at maximizing\nthe probabilities of achieving over time our goals of price stability and the maximum sustainable\neconomic growth that we associate with it. In designing strategies to meet our policy objectives, we\nhave drawn on the work of analysts, both inside and outside the Fed, who over the past half century\nhave devoted much effort to improving our understanding of the economy and its monetary\ntransmission mechanism. A critical result has been the identification of a relatively small set of key\nrelationships that, taken together, provide a useful approximation of our economy's dynamics. Such an\napproximation underlies the statistical models that we at the Federal Reserve employ to assess the\nlikely influence of our policy decisions.\nHowever, despite extensive efforts to capture and quantify what we perceive as the key\nmacroeconomic relationships, our knowledge about many of the important linkages is far from\ncomplete and, in all likelihood, will always remain so. Every model, no matter how detailed or how well\ndesigned, conceptually and empirically, is a vastly simplified representation of the world that we\nexperience with all its intricacies on a day-to-day basis.\nGiven our inevitably incomplete knowledge about key structural aspects of an ever-changing economy\nand the sometimes asymmetric costs or benefits of particular outcomes, a central bank needs to\nconsider not only the most likely future path for the economy but also the distribution of possible\noutcomes about that path. The decisionmakers then need to reach a judgment about the probabilities,\ncosts, and benefits of the various possible outcomes under alternative choices for policy.\nA policy action that is calculated to be optimal based on a simulation of one particular model may not,\nin fact, be optimal once the full extent of the risks surrounding the most likely path is taken into\naccount. In general, different policies will exhibit different degrees of robustness with respect to the\ntrue underlying structure of the economy.\nFor example, policy A might be judged as best advancing the policymakers' objectives, conditional on\na particular model of the economy, but might also be seen as having relatively severe adverse\nconsequences if the true structure of the economy turns out to be other than the one assumed. On the\nother hand, policy B might be somewhat less effective in advancing the policy objectives under the\nassumed baseline model but might be relatively benign in the event that the structure of the economy\nturns out to differ from the baseline. A year ago, these considerations inclined Federal Reserve\npolicymakers toward an easier stance of policy aimed at limiting the risk of deflation even though\nbaseline forecasts from most conventional models at that time did not project deflation; that is, we\nchose a policy that, in a world of perfect certainty, would have been judged to be too loose.\nAs this episode illustrates, policy practitioners operating under a risk-management paradigm may, at\ntimes, be led to undertake actions intended to provide insurance against especially adverse outcomes.\nFollowing the Russian debt default in the autumn of 1998, for example, the FOMC eased policy\ndespite our perception that the economy was expanding at a satisfactory pace and that, even without\na policy initiative, it was likely to continue doing so.10 We eased policy because we were concerned\nabout the low-probability risk that the default might trigger events that would severely disrupt domestic\nand international financial markets, with outsized adverse feedback to the performance of the U.S.\neconomy.\nThe product of a low-probability event and a potentially severe outcome was judged a more serious\nthreat to economic performance than the higher inflation that might ensue in the more probable\nscenario. That possibility of higher inflation caused us little concern at the time, largely because\nincreased productivity growth was resulting in only limited increases in unit labor costs and heightened\ncompetition, driven by globalization, was thwarting employers' ability to pass through those limited cost\nincreases into prices. Given the potential consequences of the Russian default, the benefits of the\nunusual policy action were judged to outweigh its costs.\nSuch a cost-benefit analysis is an ongoing part of monetary policy decisionmaking and causes us to\ntip more toward monetary ease when a contractionary event, such as the Russian default, seems\nespecially likely or the costs associated with it seem especially high.\nThe 1998 liquidity crisis and the crises associated with the stock market crash of 1987 and the\nterrorism of September 2001 prompted the type of massive ease that has been the historic mandate of\na central bank. Such crises are precipitated by the efforts of market participants to convert illiquid\nassets into cash. When confronted with uncertainty, especially Knightian uncertainty, human beings\ninvariably attempt to disengage from medium to long-term commitments in favor of safety and liquidity.\nBecause economies, of necessity, are net long - that is, have net real assets - attempts to flee these\nassets cause prices of equity assets to fall, in some cases dramatically. In the crisis that emerged in\nthe autumn of 1998, pressures extended beyond equity markets. Credit-risk spreads widened\nmaterially and investors put a particularly high value on liquidity, as evidenced by the extraordinarily\nwide yield gaps that emerged between on-the-run and off-the-run U.S. Treasuries.\nThe immediate response on the part of the central bank to such financial implosions must be to inject\nlarge quantities of liquidity - or as Walter Bagehot put it, describing such policies of the Bank of\nEngland more than a century ago, in a panic the Bank should lend at very high rates of interest \"to all\nthat bring good securities quickly, freely, and readily.\"11 This was perhaps an early articulation of a\ncrisis risk management policy for a central bank.\n* * *\nThe economic world in which we function is best described by a structure whose parameters are\ncontinuously changing. The channels of monetary policy, consequently, are changing in tandem. An\nongoing challenge for the Federal Reserve - indeed, for any central bank - is to operate in a way that\ndoes not depend on a fixed economic structure based on historically average coefficients. We often fit\nsimple models only because we cannot estimate a continuously changing set of parameters without\nvastly more observations than are currently available to us. Moreover, we recognize that the simple\nlinear functions underlying most of our econometric structures may not hold outside the range in which\nadequate economic observations exist. For example, it is difficult to have much confidence in the\nability of models fit to the data of the moderate inflations of the postwar period to accurately predict\nwhat the behavior of the economy would be in an environment of aggregate price deflation.\nIn pursuing a risk-management approach to policy, we must confront the fact that only a limited\nnumber of risks can be quantified with any confidence. And even these risks are generally quantifiable\nonly if we accept the assumption that the future will, at least in some important respects, resemble the\npast. Policymakers often have to act, or choose not to act, even though we may not fully understand\nthe full range of possible outcomes, let alone each possible outcome's likelihood. As a result, risk\nmanagement often involves significant judgment as we evaluate the risks of different events and the\nprobability that our actions will alter those risks.\nFor such judgment, policymakers have needed to reach beyond models to broader - though less\nmathematically precise - hypotheses about how the world works. For example, inferences about how\nmarket participants and, hence, the economy might respond to a monetary policy initiative may need\nto be drawn from evidence about past behavior during a period only roughly comparable to the current\nsituation.\nSome critics have argued that such an approach to policy is too undisciplined - judgmental, seemingly\ndiscretionary, and difficult to explain. The Federal Reserve, they conclude, should attempt to be more\nformal in its operations by tying its actions solely, or in the weaker paradigm, largely, to the\nprescriptions of a simple policy rule. Indeed, rules that relate the setting of the federal funds rate to the\ndeviations of output and inflation from their respective targets, in some configurations, do seem to\ncapture the broad contours of what we did over the past decade and a half. And the prescriptions of\nformal rules can, in fact, serve as helpful adjuncts to policy, as many of the proponents of these rules\nhave suggested. But at crucial points, like those in our recent policy history - the stock market crash of\n1987, the crises of 1997-98, and the events that followed September 2001 - simple rules will be\ninadequate as either descriptions or prescriptions for policy. Moreover, such rules suffer from much of\nthe same fixed-coefficient difficulties we have with our large-scale models.\nTo be sure, sensible policymaking can be accomplished only with the aid of a rigorous analytic\nstructure. A rule does provide a benchmark against which to assess emerging developments.\nHowever, any rule capable of encompassing every possible contingency would lose a key aspect of its\nattractiveness: simplicity. On the other hand, no simple rule could possibly describe the policy action to\nbe taken in every contingency and thus provide a satisfactory substitute for an approach based on the\nprinciples of risk management.\nAs I indicated earlier, policy has worked off a risk-management paradigm in which the risk and\ncostbenefit analyses depend on forecasts of probabilities developed from large macromodels, numerous\nsubmodels, and judgments based on less mathematically precise regimens. Such judgments, by their\nnature, are based on bits and pieces of history that cannot formally be associated with an analysis of\nvariance.\nYet, there is information in those bits and pieces. For example, while we have been unable to readily\nconstruct a variable that captures the apparent increased degree of flexibility in the United States or\nthe global economy, there has been too much circumstantial evidence of this critically important trend\nto ignore its existence. Increased flexibility is a likely source of changing structural coefficients.\nOur problem is not, as is sometimes alleged, the complexity of our policymaking process, but the far\ngreater complexity of a world economy whose underlying linkages appear to be continuously evolving.\nOur response to that continuous evolution has been disciplined by the Bayesian type of\ndecisionmaking in which we have engaged.\n* * *\nWhile all, no doubt, would prefer that it were otherwise, there is no way to dismiss what has to be\nobvious to every monetary policymaker: The success of monetary policy depends importantly on the\nquality of forecasting. The ability to gauge risks implies some judgment about how current economic\nimbalances will ultimately play out.\nThus, both econometric and qualitative models need to be continually tested. The first signs that a\nrelationship may have changed is usually the emergence of events that seem inconsistent with our\nhypotheses of the way the economic world is supposed to behave. The anomalous rise in high-tech\ncapital goods orders in 1993, to which I alluded earlier, is one such example. The credit crunch of the\nearly 1990s is another.\nThe emergence of inflation targeting in recent years is an interesting development in this regard. As\npracticed, it emphasizes forecasts, but within a more rule-like structure that skews monetary policy\ntoward inflation containment as the primary goal. Indeed, its early applications were in high-inflation\ncountries where discretionary monetary policy fell into disrepute.\nInflation targeting often originated as a fairly simple structure concentrating solely on inflation\noutcomes, but it has evolved into more-discretionary forms requiring complex judgments for\nimplementation. Indeed, this evolution has gone so far that the actual practice of monetary policy by\ninflation-targeting central banks now closely resembles the practice of those central banks, such as\nthe European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Federal Reserve, that have not chosen to\nadopt that paradigm.\nIn practice, most central banks, at least those not bound by an exchange rate peg, behave in roughly\nthe same way. They seek price stability as their long-term goal and, accounting for the lag in monetary\npolicy, calibrate the setting of the policy rate accordingly. Central banks generally appear to have\nembraced a common model of the channels through which monetary policy functions, although the\nspecifics and emphasis given to those channels vary according to our particular circumstances. All\nbanks ease when economic conditions ease and tighten when economic conditions tighten, even if in\ndiffering degrees, regardless of whether they are guided by formal or informal inflation targets.\nAs yet unresolved is whether the mere announcement that a central bank intends to engage in\ninflation targeting increases the credibility of the central bank's inclination to maintain price stability\nand, hence, assists in the anchoring of inflation expectations. The Bank of England's recent\nexperiences may be encouraging in this regard. But, presumably, we will not know for sure the\nsignificance of formal inflation targeting as a tool until the world economy is subjected to shocks of\nsufficient magnitude to assess the differential performance of those who do not employ formally\nannounced inflation targets. To date, inflation has fallen for formal targeters, but it has fallen for others\nas well.\n* * *\nUnder the rubric of risk management are a number of specific issues that we at the Fed had to\naddress over the past decade and a half and that will likely resurface to confront future monetary\npolicymakers.\nMost prominent is the appropriate role of asset prices in policy. In addition to the narrower issue of\nproduct price stability, asset prices will remain high on the research agenda of central banks for years\nto come. As the ratios of gross liabilities and gross assets to GDP continue to rise, owing to expanding\ndomestic and international financial intermediation, the visibility of asset prices relative to product\nprices will itself rise. There is little dispute that the prices of stocks, bonds, homes, real estate, and\nexchange rates affect GDP. But most central banks have chosen, at least to date, not to view asset\nprices as targets of policy, but as economic variables to be considered through the prism of the\npolicy's ultimate objective.\n* * *\nAs the transcripts of FOMC meetings attest, making monetary policy is an especially humbling activity.\nIn hindsight, the paths of inflation, real output, stock prices and exchange rates may have seemed\npreordained, but no such insight existed as we experienced it at the time. In fact, uncertainty\ncharacterized virtually every meeting, and, as the transcripts show, our ability to anticipate was limited.\nFrom time to time the FOMC made decisions, some to move and some not to move, that we came to\nregret.\nYet, during the last quarter century, policymakers managed to defuse dangerous inflationary forces\nand dealt with the consequences of a stock market crash, a large asset price bubble, and a series of\nliquidity crises. These events did not distract us from the pursuit and eventual achievement of price\nstability and the greater economic stability that goes with it.\nAs we confront the many unspecifiable dangers that lie ahead, the marked improvement in the degree\nof flexibility and resilience exhibited by our economy in recent years should afford us considerable\ncomfort.12 Assuming that it will persist, the trend toward increased flexibility implies that an\nevergreater part of the resolution of economic imbalances will occur through the actions of business firms\nand households. Less will be required from the risk-laden initiatives of monetary policymakers.\nEach generation of policymakers has had to grapple with a changing portfolio of problems. So while\nwe eagerly draw on the experiences of our predecessors, we can be assured that we will confront\ndifferent problems in the future. The innovative technologies that have helped us reap enormous\nefficiencies will doubtless present us with challenges that we cannot currently anticipate.\nWe were fortunate, as I pointed out in my opening remarks, to have worked in a particularly favorable\nstructural and political environment. But we trust that monetary policy has meaningfully contributed to\nthe impressive performance of our economy in recent decades.",

         "Ben S Bernanke: Monetary policy and the economic outlook - 2004\nSpeech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the meetings of the American Economic Association, San Diego, 4 January 2004.\nThe references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.\n* * *\nThe turn of the year is the traditional time to review the high and low points of the year just past and to\ncontemplate the challenges that lie ahead in the year just begun. In that spirit, I will provide a brief\nprogress report on the economic recovery, as well as some remarks on the evolution of monetary\npolicy. As always, the views I will express are my own and are not to be attributed to my colleagues on\nthe Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.1\nIt is beginning to appear that 2003 was a watershed year for the American economy, following what\nhad been, on many dimensions, a subpar performance for the better part of three years. Though\nofficially the recession lasted only eight months, from March to November 2001, a period of economic\nunderperformance began with the sharp decline in stock prices and business investment in mid-2000\nand continued through the months leading up to the Iraq war this past spring. To a degree that is\nunusual for postwar recessions, the economic weakness of the period was most apparent in the\nbusiness sector, even as consumer spending and residential construction remained robust.\nBusinesses radically pared their spending on new capital goods and cut the ratio of inventory stocks to\nsales to historical lows. In an effort to restore profitability in an environment of weak demand and\nnonexistent pricing power, businesses also worked hard to improve efficiency and cut costs. These\nefforts have paid off in terms of remarkable increases in productivity, but, together with insufficient\ngrowth in aggregate demand, they also contributed to a significant decline in employment. Like the\naftermath of the 1990-91 recession, the two years since the recession trough in November 2001 have\nbeen described as a \"jobless recovery.\" Indeed, the lag between the recovery in output and the\nrecovery in employment has been significantly greater this time than it was after the 1990-91\ndownturn.\nMonetary policy was deployed to support the weakening economy, as the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) aggressively cut rates in 2001 and has continued its policy of accommodation\nsince then. Fiscal policy, including two rounds of tax cuts, has also been highly stimulative. However,\ndespite some early promise, initially the upturn proved halting and erratic. Policymakers and\nprivatesector economists recognized early on that a balanced recovery would require willingness on the part\nof the business sector to begin investing and hiring again, but forecasts of improved business\nsentiment repeatedly proved wrong, or at least premature. In some sectors, such as nonresidential\nconstruction and communications, capital overhangs and capital misallocation, the result of the earlier\nboom, reduced both the need and the financial capacity to invest. Importantly, the economy was also\nhit by a succession of shocks - notably the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the corporate\ngovernance and accounting scandals of the summer of 2002, and the Iraq war in the spring of 2003 -\neach of which created new uncertainties and left its mark on business confidence.\nDespite all this adversity, there could never have been any doubt that the diversified and resilient U.S.\neconomy, assisted by ample monetary and fiscal stimulus, would eventually stage a comeback. After\nseveral false starts, it now appears that that comeback began in earnest in the summer of 2003. As\nyou know, the third quarter of the year displayed near-record levels of real economic growth, in the\nvicinity of 8 percent at an annual rate, and growth appears to have continued strong in the fourth\nquarter of 2003. The most heartening aspect of this vigorous expansion is that, finally, the business\nsector appears to have emerged from its funk. Corporate investment has been strong, particularly in\nequipment and software, and there are some recent signs that both inventory investment and hiring\nhave begun to pick up.\nOf course, downside risks to the economy remain: The recovery in capital investment may prove less\ndurable than it now appears, the moderation of fiscal stimulus in the latter part of next year could\nadversely affect household spending, or new unfavorable shocks - geopolitical or otherwise - may yet\nappear. Still, the incoming data have continued for the most part to surprise on the upside, and the\nodds accordingly have increased that 2003 will be remembered as the year when this recovery turned\nthe corner. Private-sector forecasters generally expect real growth to be approximately 4 percent in\n2004, and they foresee modest improvements in the unemployment rate this year and continued\nreductions in unemployment in 2005. I think these predictions are broadly reasonable, and indeed I\nwould not be surprised if the pace of real growth next year exceeded 4 percent.\nWith this generally upbeat scenario in mind, some observers in the markets and the media have\nquestioned the appropriateness of the current stance of monetary policy. Certainly, the policy stance\nwe have today is historically unusual. More than two years after the recession trough, and following\nseveral quarters of strong growth, the historically normal pattern would be for the Fed to be well into\nthe process of tightening policy by now. Instead, the FOMC has held its policy instrument rate, the\nfederal funds rate, at the very low level of 1 percent. I would like to take some time now to explain why\nI believe this policy remains appropriate, despite its historically unusual character.\nThe positive case for maintaining an accommodative monetary policy at this stage of the recovery has\nthree elements, some of which will be familiar to many of you, at least in broad outline.\nFirst, core inflation rates in the United States are as low today as they have been in forty years, and\nthey have been trending downward. For example, the twelve-month inflation rate as measured by the\nconsumer price index, current-methods basis and excluding food and energy prices, was 2.7 percent\nat the recession trough in November 2001. This measure of core inflation fell to 2.0 percent as of\nNovember 2002 and to only 1.1 percent as of November 2003. Other measures of core inflation, such\nas the one based on the chain price index for personal consumption expenditures, have displayed a\nsimilar pattern. Inflation is not simply low; for my taste, it is very nearly at the bottom of the acceptable\nrange for (measured) inflation. In contrast, in previous episodes of recovery, inflation was above the\nrange consistent with price stability, so that a tightening of monetary policy at an earlier stage of the\nexpansion represented the prudent response to inflation risks. Because inflation is so low today,\nmonetary policy can afford to be more patient to ensure that the recovery is self-sustaining.\nThe second unusual aspect of the current situation relevant for monetary policy is the truly remarkable\nincrease in labor productivity that firms and workers have achieved in recent years. Those productivity\nincreases affect the inflation outlook in two related ways: first, by raising potential output and thus (for\ngiven growth in aggregate demand) the size of the output gap; and, second, by reducing the costs of\nproduction, which puts downward pressure on prices. I will first address the effect of productivity on\ncosts, returning later to the link of productivity and the output gap.\nLabor costs account for the lion's share, about two-thirds, of the cost of producing goods and services.\nThe labor cost of producing a unit of output depends, first, on the dollar cost per hour (including wages\nand benefits) of employing a worker and, second, on the quantity of output that each worker produces\nper hour. When the cost per hour of employing a worker rises more quickly than the worker's hourly\nproductivity - the historically normal situation - then the dollar labor cost of producing each unit of\noutput, the so-called unit labor cost, tends to rise. Recently, however, labor productivity has grown\neven more quickly than the costs of employing workers, with the result that unit labor costs have\ndeclined in each of the past three years. Indeed, in the second and third quarters of 2003, unit labor\ncosts in the nonfarm business sector are currently estimated to have declined by a remarkable 3.2 and\n5.8 percent, respectively, at annual rates.\nAgain, because labor costs are such a large part of overall costs, and because capital costs have also\nbeen moderate, the business sector has enjoyed a net decline in total production costs. A decline in\nproduction costs must result in lower prices for final consumers, an increased price-cost markup for\nproducers, or both. In practice, both have occurred in recent years: Firms have passed on part of the\nreduction in costs on to final consumers in the form of lower (or more slowly rising) prices, and\npricecost markups (as best we can measure them) have risen well above their historical averages. The\nhigh level of markups is an important and perhaps insufficiently recognized feature of the current\neconomic situation. To the extent that firms can maintain these markups, profits will continue to be\nhigh, supporting investment and equity values. To the extent that product-market competition erodes\nthese markups, as is likely to occur over time, downward pressure will be exerted on the inflation rate,\neven if, as is likely, the recent declines in unit labor cost do not persist.2\nThe third unusual factor is the persistent softness of the labor market. As I already noted, fully two\nyears after the official recession trough, we are only just beginning to see significant gains in\nemployment. Of course, the unemployment rate, at about 6 percent of the labor force, is not\nexceptionally high by historical standards, and one can debate the degree to which structural change\nand other factors may have affected the level of employment that can be sustained without\noverheating the economy. Assessing the amount of slack in the labor market is very difficult and\nultimately a matter of judgment. Reasonable people can certainly disagree.\nHowever, my sense is that, when one looks at the full range of information available, the labor market\nlooks (if anything) weaker than a 6 percent unemployment rate suggests. For example, it appears that\nworkers who have lost their jobs in the past couple of years have been more likely to withdraw from\nthe labor force (rather than report themselves as unemployed) than were job losers in previous\nrecessions. Indeed, the labor force participation rate fell sharply between 2000 and 2003, from a little\nover 67 percent to about 66-1/4 percent. Similarly, the ratio of employment to the working-age\npopulation, a statistic that reflects both those who become unemployed and those who leave the labor\nforce, has fallen significantly, by 2.8 percentage points between its peak in April 2000 and its trough\nthis past September. The tendency of recent job losers to leave the labor force likely masks some of\nthe effects of job cuts on the unemployment rate, so that the current measured level of unemployment\nmay understate the extent of job loss or the difficulty of finding new work. Of course, a labor market\nthat is slack and improving only slowly is likely to produce continued slow growth in nominal wages,\ncontributing to continued moderate growth in costs.\nWhy has the labor market remained relatively weak, despite increasingly rapid growth in output? I\naddressed the causes of the \"jobless recovery\" in an earlier talk (Bernanke, 2003). Although many\nfactors have affected the rate of job creation, I concluded in my earlier analysis that the rapid rate of\nproductivity growth, already discussed in relation to unit labor costs, has also been an important\nreason for the slow pace of recovery in the labor market. All else equal, strong productivity gains allow\nfirms to meet a given level of demand with fewer employees. Thus, for given growth in aggregate\nspending, a higher rate of productivity growth implies a slower rate of growth in employment.3\nTo summarize, then, the current economic situation has three unusual aspects, which together (in my\nview) rationalize the current stance of monetary policy. First, inflation is historically low, perhaps at the\nbottom of the acceptable range, and has recently continued its decline. Second, rapid productivity\ngrowth has led to actual declines in nominal production costs, which reduce current and future\ninflationary pressures. Finally, the labor market remains soft, reflecting the fact that growth in\naggregate demand has been so far insufficient to absorb the increases in aggregate supply afforded\nby higher productivity. A soft labor market will keep a lid on the growth in the cost of employing\nworkers. An accommodative monetary policy is needed, in my view, to support the ongoing recovery,\nparticularly in the labor market. At the same time, the risks of policy accommodation seem low, as\ninflation is low and inflation pressures seem quite subdued.\nThese arguments notwithstanding, I realize that some remain unconvinced that the FOMC is pursuing\nthe right course. Citing factors such as the rise in commodity prices and the decline of the dollar, a\nnumber of observers have warned that the Federal Reserve's policies risk re-igniting inflation. I would\nlike to address these concerns briefly. Naturally, I will try to show why these arguments are not of\nimmediate concern, given the three points I made earlier in support of the current accommodative\npolicy. Before I do that, though, I would like to emphasize to those uncomfortable with the Fed's policy\nstance that, speaking for myself at least, their views are being heard and taken seriously. Achieving\nprice stability in the United States was an historic accomplishment, and preserving that legacy is\ncrucially important. I say that not only because I think that price stability promotes long-run growth and\nefficiency, which I do, but also because I believe that low inflation and well-anchored inflation\nexpectations are critical to maintaining economic stability in the short run. Price stability is of utmost\nimportance to the nation's economic health, and I believe that the FOMC will do whatever is necessary\nto be sure that inflation remains well contained.\nWith that preface, I will address briefly a few concerns of those who worry that inflation is poised to\nrise, beginning with the recent behavior of commodity prices.\nA number of commodity price indexes have indeed risen sharply over the past couple of years,\nincluding a large jump in the past several months. This acceleration has been broadly mirrored in the\nbehavior of the core producer price indexes (PPIs) for crude and intermediate materials, probably the\nbest and most comprehensive measures of prices at early stages of processing. Specifically, over the\npast two years, the twelve-month change in the core PPI for crude materials has risen rather\ndramatically, from -9.4 percent to 17.1 percent, and the twelve-month change in the core PPI for\nintermediate materials has risen from -1.3 percent to 1.8 percent. Do these developments imply a\nsignificant increase in inflation risk at the level of the final consumer?\nThe answer is almost certainly not. Two points should be made. First, the recent movements in\ncommodity prices are hardly surprising; they are in fact quite normal for this stage of the business\ncycle. The acceleration in the core PPI for crude materials that we have seen is about what should\nhave been expected, given the increases that have occurred recently in both domestic and worldwide\neconomic activity.4 The increase in the demand for commodities from China alone has been\nsubstantial; for example, that country's share of world copper consumption is estimated to have risen\nfrom less than 5 percent in 1990 to 20 percent in 2003. The much more moderate acceleration in\nintermediate goods prices can likewise be traced to the increase in economic activity, with some\nadditional effect coming from the decline in the dollar and the indirect impact of increases in energy\nprices.\nSecond, the direct effects of commodity price inflation on consumer inflation are empirically minuscule,\nboth because raw materials costs are a small portion of total cost and because part of any increase in\nthe cost of materials tends to be absorbed in the margins of final goods producers and distributors.\nAccelerations in commodity prices comparable to or larger than the most recent one occurred\nfollowing the 1981-82 and 1990-91 recessions, as well as in 1986-87 and 1999, with no noticeable\nimpact on inflation at the consumer level.5 A reasonable rule of thumb is that a permanent 10 percent\nincrease in raw materials prices will lead to perhaps a 0.7 percent increase in the price of intermediate\ngoods and to less than a 0.1 percent increase in consumer prices. Thus the recent acceleration in\ncommodity prices, even if it were to persist (and futures prices suggest that it will not), would likely add\nonly a tenth or two to the core inflation rate. In short, rising commodity prices are a better signal of\nstrengthening economic activity than of inflation at the consumer level.\nTwo specific commodity prices that often command attention are the prices of gold and crude\npetroleum. The price of gold has increased roughly 60 percent since its low in April 2001, from about\n$255 per ounce to about $410 per ounce. A portion of that increase simply reflects dollar depreciation,\nwhich I will discuss momentarily. Gold also represents a safe haven investment, however, and I agree\nthat there have been periods in the past when the fear that drove investors into gold was the fear of\ninflation. But gold prices also respond to geopolitical tensions; these tensions have certainly\nheightened since 2001 and, in my view, can account for the bulk of the recent increase in the real\nprice of gold.\nOil prices are relatively high, in the range of $33/barrel, but they have been elevated for most of the\npast four years, despite a broadly disinflationary environment. According to futures markets, oil prices\nare expected to decline gradually over the next two years, despite accelerating economic activity, as\nnew supplies are brought on line. Of course, there is considerable uncertainty about what the price of\noil will do, given the possibility of supply disruptions. But if it follows the course projected by the futures\nmarket, the price of oil should have a modest disinflationary effect on overall consumer prices in the\nnext couple of years.\nLet me turn now to the recent depreciation of the dollar and its implications for inflation. The dollar has\nfallen dramatically against some major currencies, notably the euro, against which the dollar has\ndeclined roughly 30 percent from its recent peak in the first quarter of 2002. However, looking at\nmovements of the dollar against a single currency can be misleading about overall trends; broader\nmeasures of dollar strength show somewhat less of a decline. For example, an index of the dollar's\nreal value against the currencies of important U.S. trading partners, weighted by trade shares, has\nfallen only about 12 percent from its peak in the first quarter of 2002. Notably, this broader index of\ndollar value remains about 7 percent above its average value in the 1990s and 17 percent above the\nlow it reached in the second quarter of 1995.\nMoreover, the direct effects of dollar depreciation on inflation, like those of commodity price increases,\nappear to be relatively small. In part, the small effect reflects the modest weight of imports in the\nconsumer's basket of goods and services. Perhaps more importantly, however, the evidence suggests\nthat foreign producers tend to absorb most of the effect of changes in the value of the dollar rather\nthan \"passing through\" these effects to the prices they charge U.S. consumers. A reasonable estimate\nof the portion of changes in the value of the dollar passed through to U.S. consumers is about\n30 percent. The extent of passthrough also appears to have declined over time, suggesting that\nforeign producers also lack \"pricing power\" in the current low-inflation environment in the United\nStates. Overall, on rough estimates, a 10 percent decline in the broad value of the dollar would be\nexpected to add between one and three tenths to the level of core consumer prices (not the inflation\nrate), spread out over a period of time.\nI haven't said anything yet about the rate of growth of the money supply, another indicator that is\nsometimes cited by those concerned about inflation, largely because there is not too much to say.\nGrowth in standard monetary measures such as the base and M2 has been moderate (and declining)\nin recent years, certainly well within expected ranges given the growth of nominal GDP and normal\nvariation in velocity. For example, for 2003 as a whole, growth in both the monetary base and M2\nshould be about equal to growth in nominal GDP. Even should money growth rates accelerate,\nhowever, I would caution against making strong inferences about the likely behavior of inflation, except\nin the very long run. Money growth has not proven to be especially useful for predicting inflation in the\nshort run, in part because various institutional factors unrelated to monetary policy often affect the\ngrowth rate of money. A striking example of the way special factors can affect money growth rates is\nthe fact that M2 growth has actually been sharply negative, at about -5 percent at an annual rate, for\nthe past three months for which data are available. Factors such as the falloff in mortgage refinancing\nactivity and outflows from retail money market funds into equities and other investments are the\nproximate explanations for the decline in M2. Certainly, this short-term decline in broad money is not\nto be taken as evidence of tight monetary policy!6\nTo summarize, 2003 seems to have marked the turning point for the U. S. economy, and we have\nreason to be optimistic that 2004 will see even more growth and continued progress in reducing\nunemployment. The remarkable strength and resiliency of the American economy - an economy that\nhas shown the capacity to grow and become more productive in the face of serious adverse shocks -\ndeserve most of the credit for these developments. Highly stimulative monetary and fiscal policies\nhave also played a role, of course.\nThe Federal Reserve enters 2004 with monetary policy that is unusually accommodative in historical\nterms, relative to the stage of the business cycle. That accommodation is justified, I believe, by the\ncurrent very low level of inflation, and by the productivity gains and the weakness in the labor market,\nboth of which suggest that inflation is likely to remain subdued. In my view, weighing the relative costs\nof the upside and downside risks also favors accommodation; in particular, it is important that we\nensure, as best we can, that the current expansion will become self-sustaining and that the inflation\nrate does not fall further.\nOn the other side, as I have already noted, the achievement of price stability must not and will not be\njeopardized. We at the Federal Reserve will closely monitor developments in prices and wages, as\nwell as conditions in the labor market and the broader economy, for any sign of incipient inflation. We\nwill also look at the information that can be drawn from surveys and financial markets about inflation\nexpectations. For now, I believe that the Federal Reserve has the luxury of being patient. However, I\nam also confident that, when the time comes, the Fed will act to ensure that inflation remains firmly\nunder control.",

         "Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Lessons from past productivity booms\nSpeech by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal\nReserve System, at the meetings of the American Economic Association, San Diego, 4 January 2004.\nThe references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.\n* * *\nAs we are all well aware, the United States has been enjoying significantly faster productivity growth\nfor the past eight years or so than it did over the preceding two decades. Since 1995, labor\nproductivity has risen at an average annual rate of about 3 percent, up from an average annual rate of\naround 1-1/2 percent between 1973 and 1995. And in the past two years alone, output per hour has\nincreased more than 5 percent per year.\nThe significance of the improvement since 1995 can hardly be overstated, even after taking into\naccount the cyclical component of the most recent quarters. If productivity were to continue to improve\nat an average annual rate of 3 percent, the standard of living in the United States would double\nroughly every twenty-four years. If, on the other hand, productivity growth were to revert to an average\nannual pace of 1-1/2 percent, a doubling in the standard of living would occur only every forty-seven\nyears. Many observers-including some economists-argue that the present era of robust trend\nproductivity growth will soon come to an end. Others are more optimistic and argue that the potential\ngains to productivity from the technological advances associated with the computer revolution are far\nfrom complete.1 Because productivity growth is critical to economic welfare, assessing the likelihood of\nthese alternative outcomes is of considerable interest.\nIn thinking about this issue, it is worth recognizing that periods of strong trend productivity growth,\nalthough perhaps novel to many of us, are not new to the U.S. economy. In fact, three earlier periods\nseem to stand out from the historical record as especially worthy of further scrutiny for the lessons\nthey may offer regarding the current episode: a period in the late 1800s from roughly the end of the\nCivil War to around 1890; the decade or so between the end of World War I and the onset of the Great\nDepression; and the period from about 1950 to the early 1970s.2\nOf particular note is that in at least two of the earlier episodes, heightened productivity growth lasted\nfor an extended period - roughly twenty years or so. Thus, one objective in examining these previous\nproductivity booms is to see whether we can glean any insights into the best ways to sustain the\ncurrent episode of strong productivity growth. To be sure, each period mentioned can be associated\nwith particular advances in technology, implying that technological progress is a necessary component\nof trend productivity growth. But significant technological advances were also evident in periods when\nproductivity growth was less robust. Thus, a natural question to ask is whether other complementary\nfactors - including aspects of the labor market, of the business environment, or of government policies\n- combine to render technological change especially potent or help to foster the transmission of\ntechnological change into real gains in the efficiency of the production process.\nSimilarly, examining the historical record may shed light on the sustainability of the current boom. Do\nproductivity booms simply run out of steam and die natural deaths? Or are they cut short by economic\nimbalances, exogenous shocks, or detrimental government policies? And, if the latter, are these\ncessations inevitable?\nAt the outset, I should note that this lecture is co-authored with William Wascher, who is a member of\nthe staff at the Board of Governors. To provide a roadmap of where we intend to go, I want to start by\nsetting out some basic facts about previous periods of strong productivity growth in the United States. I\nwill, of course, begin with some numbers. But I also want to discuss some of the technological\ninnovations that contributed to these productivity booms and about the supportive roles played by\nchanges in the organization of American businesses and the structure of financial markets, and by the\nU.S. education system. Finally, I will spend some time on the lessons that we think can be learned\nfrom what, in many ways, are striking similarities across the three previous episodes and the current\none.\nIdentifying previous productivity booms\nI should also note at this point that even the basic facts about economic growth, not to mention the\ninterpretation of those facts, are sometimes subject to considerable debate. Some of these\ndisagreements undoubtedly result from the lack of consistent information on U.S. productivity before\ndata from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) became available in 1948. For this earlier period, we\nuse data developed in the early 1960s by John Kendrick, who constructed estimates of GDP\nconsistent with the prevailing definitions in the National Income and Product Accounts going back to\nthe 1870s (which had as their basis estimates made by Simon Kuznets in the 1940s).3 These\nestimates are often cited as the best available measure of U.S output and productivity growth for that\nperiod. Although subsequent researchers - notably Balke and Gordon (1989) and Romer (1989) -\nhave refined these estimates in different ways, the additional refinements focus primarily on the\ncyclical properties of output and do not significantly alter the qualitative statements about long-run\ngrowth made here. A number of economic historians - most notably Robert Gallman - have estimated\nU.S. GDP for the period before the Civil War.4 However, given that their estimates are surely less\nreliable than those for the later, more industrialized period, we have elected to limit the focus of this\nlecture to the post-Civil War period.\nThese caveats aside, average growth rates of productivity over various periods are presented in the\ntable. We will focus on labor productivity (the first column) because that measure is the best indicator\nof improvement in the nation's standard of living. For the entire period from 1870 to 2003, labor\nproductivity has risen at an average rate of around 2 percent per year. However, productivity growth\nhas not proceeded in a steady fashion. We have chosen time periods for our analysis that smooth\nthrough the business cycle, which is a significant source of shorter-term changes in rates of\nproductivity growth. More important for this discussion is the variation in labor productivity growth that\nhas occurred over longer stretches of time, with periods of robust growth interspersed with periods of\nmore modest productivity gains.\nUsing the Kendrick data as a guide and recognizing that the choice of any particular period is\nsomewhat subjective, we take as the first episode of strong productivity growth - or productivity boom,\nif you will - roughly the period from 1873 to 1890. During this period, labor productivity rose more than\n2-1/2 percent per year, a rate thought to be considerably higher than the average growth experienced\nover the first 100 years of the United States.5 An important element of the analysis of this and other\nperiods is the decomposition of output per hour into its underlying sources, including the contributions\nof multifactor productivity, capital deepening, and labor quality. In this regard, Kendrick's\ndecomposition suggests that labor productivity growth in the late 1800s was fueled importantly by\ncapital investment.6\nDuring the next three decades, from 1890 to 1917, the growth rate of labor productivity slowed to an\naverage pace of only 1-1/2 percent per year, with modest rates of growth both in the capital stock and\nin multifactor productivity. The United States then enjoyed a relatively brief spurt in productivity until\nabout 1927, with labor productivity rising about 3-3/4 percent per year and multifactor productivity up\naround 2 3/4 percent per year. This productivity boom was led by the expansion of the automobile\nindustry and robust productivity gains in manufacturing more generally. Productivity growth was\nmarkedly slower through the Great Depression and World War II, largely reflecting a lack of capital\ndeepening. Multifactor productivity rose at a relatively solid pace - albeit not as fast as earlier in the\ncentury - despite the weak economy during much of that period.\nProductivity growth since World War II is more familiar to us and is based on more reliable data - those\nconstructed as part of the multifactor productivity program at the BLS. According to these data, labor\nproductivity rose at an annual rate of close to 3 percent from 1948 to 1973 - a period sometimes\nreferred to as the golden age of productivity growth. During this period, productivity accelerated across\na broad range of industries, and both capital deepening and gains in multifactor productivity\ncontributed to the strong pace of growth. The productivity slowdown of the 1970s and 1980s is also\nwell known to us, and its possible causes have been the subject of much research. Labor productivity\ngrowth slowed to an average pace of 1.4 percent per year over this period, while multifactor\nproductivity growth fell to a pace of 0.4 percent, the slowest pace of any of the periods shown on the\ntable. Finally, labor productivity growth has averaged about 3 percent at an annual rate since 1995,\nwith higher rates of both capital deepening and multifactor productivity growth contributing to the\npickup.\nSources of past productivity booms: technological change\nAlthough the productivity booms of the past century and a quarter obviously differed in many respects,\neach episode can readily be associated with the introduction of one or more new technologies. The\nboom after the Civil War, for instance, appears to have had its genesis in technological improvements\nthat increased the flexibility of production and reduced transportation costs, which allowed firms to\ntake advantage of economies of scale in production and distribution.\nIn particular, the widespread introduction of steam engines and machinery driven by new sources of\nenergy enabled firms to move away from sources of waterpower and closer to areas where inputs -\nincluding labor and raw materials - were more readily available. The Midwest - where sources of\nwaterpower were less abundant but coal was more abundant - benefited greatly from this\ndevelopment, and indeed within a few decades became known as the \"industrial heartland\" of the\nUnited States. This regional shift in economic activity is illustrated by a sharp rise in the share of\npersonal income generated in the Midwest between 1840 and 1880 (from 20 percent to 35 percent),\nand the commensurate decline in the share of income generated in the Northeast (from 43 percent to\n31 percent).7\nThe increase in the importance of railroad transportation also helped raise productivity growth in the\nsecond half of the nineteenth century.8 Improved methods of steel production - notably, the Bessemer\nprocess, and later, Siemens's open hearth method - enabled railroads to lay longer-lasting steel track\nrather than iron track. And the growth of telegraphy enabled railroads to better coordinate the\nmovement of trains over a wider area. As a result, railroads expanded their geographic coverage\nsignificantly after the Civil War: From 1860 to 1890, the number of main track miles operated by\nrailroad companies more than quintupled, from 31,000 miles to 167,000 miles, while the number of\nfreight cars in operation jumped from 185,000 to more than 1 million.9\nThe expansion of the railroads drove transportation costs sharply lower and allowed a significant\nincrease in market size. Whereas, in 1830, the transportation of goods from New York to Chicago had\nrequired three weeks even during the warmer months of the year, by 1870, it could be accomplished in\nthree days any time of the year.10 In addition, the construction of new rail lines in western states\nopened those markets to a wide range of East Coast and Midwest manufacturers. Moreover, some of\nthe benefits of the productivity improvements in the railroad industry were passed on to producers in\nthe form of lower costs of transporting goods. Freight rates fell from 2-1/4 cents per ton-mile in 1860 to\nless than 1 cent per ton-mile by 1890. As a result, the quantity of goods transported by rail increased\nsharply, from about 12 billion ton-miles in 1870 to 80 billion ton-miles in 1890.11\nAnother major technological advance in the mid-1800s was the telegraph. Besides aiding the\nexpansion of railroads by improving the coordination of rail traffic, the telegraph sharply reduced the\ncosts of communicating in many other industries. And judging from the rapid growth in its use - the\nnumber of messages handled rose from about 9 million in 1870 to nearly 56 million in 1890 - the\ntelegraph undoubtedly contributed to better decisionmaking and higher productivity throughout the\neconomy.12\nAgriculture also was increasingly mechanized in the decades immediately after the Civil War, though\nthe change was not as impressive as in the industrial sector. The abundance of land in western states\nlimited the interest among farmers in raising land productivity. However, labor services were more\ndifficult to obtain, so farmers were quite willing to invest in labor-saving machinery. As a result, the\nbetter plows, seed drills, reapers, and threshers developed by manufacturers were in high demand by\nfarmers, and the amount of labor required to farm an acre of land fell sharply for many crops.13\nIn the productivity boom of the early twentieth century, the chief technological innovation was most\nlikely the spread of electrification to the factory floor. As Paul David and others have extensively\ndocumented, the use of electric motors in the production process increased substantially in the first\nquarter of the century.14 In particular, the amount of mechanical energy derived from electric motors\nrose from 475,000 horsepower in 1899 to nearly 34 million horsepower in 1929, and the fraction of\noverall factory horsepower produced with electricity rose from less than 5 percent to more than\n80 percent over that period.15\nA major benefit of electric motors was that they enabled each machine in a factory to be powered by\nits own motor. This allowed manufacturing plants to be organized in a way that maximized the efficient\nmovement of materials rather than the efficient transmission of power, and it facilitated the spread of\ncontinuous processing techniques and the assembly lines made popular by Henry Ford. Indeed, as\nelectric power became less costly - aided by a steep reduction in regulated electricity rates after World\nWar I - its use increased sharply, and factory productivity rose significantly. By one estimate,\nproductivity growth in the manufacturing sector as a whole rose about 5-1/2 percent per year between\n1919 and 1929.16\nOf course, other technological innovations also contributed to productivity growth during this period.\nNotable among them were the telephone - which by the 1920s had largely replaced the telegraph; the\ninternal combustion engine, the use of which in motorized vehicles led to sizable productivity gains in\nthe transportation and agriculture sectors; and a variety of technological advances in machine tools. In\naddition, the early 1900s were characterized by the first wave of office automation equipment,\nincluding the portable typewriter and adding and duplicating machines. These machines improved the\nefficiency of a wide range of management and accounting tasks, and the demand for such equipment\nrose quite sharply between 1900 and the late 1920s. Indeed, in real terms, business investment in\noffice equipment increased from about $50 million (in 1929 dollars) in 1899 to nearly $500 million in\n1929, with a particularly large jump evident in the 1920s.17\nThe productivity gains of the 1950s and 1960s, in part, had their roots in the technological innovations\narising out of research sponsored by the military during World War II.18 For example, although\nresearch advances in synthetic polymerization chemistry (most notably, the introduction of catalytic\ncracking in the processing of crude oil) were made in the 1920s and 1930s, the synthetic rubber\nprogram launched during the war led to mass production of the first synthetic polymer from\npetroleumbased feedstocks. Similarly, production of polyethylene, a petrochemical-based plastic discovered in\nthe 1930s, jumped sharply in the 1940s because of its widespread use in military equipment. And, the\nmilitary's need for large stocks of penicillin led to a production process for it that turned out to have\napplicability to a wide range of pharmaceuticals.\nThe commercialization of these wartime innovations sharply increased the number of products made\nwholly or partly from newly developed plastic polymers and other synthetic materials. The use of\npolyethylene, for example, grew sharply after the war, while additional technological advances isolated\nnew forms of synthetics and further reduced production costs for chemicals and pharmaceuticals.\nOverall, production in the rubber and plastic products industry rose nearly 7 percent per year between\n1947 and 1970, while the output of the chemical products industry rose more than 8 percent annually\nover the same period.19\nTwo other notable technological advances during this period were the invention of the transistor in\n1947 and the use of the jet engine in commercial aircraft. Commercial applications of the transistor,\ninitially in solid state consumer electronic products, were stimulated by improvements in the fabrication\nprocess (in 1954) and by the introduction of the integrated circuit (in 1958). With the rise in demand,\nsemiconductor production jumped markedly, rising nearly 20 percent per year during the 1960s.20\nSimilarly, the introduction of the Boeing 707 in 1958 sharply reduced the time and cost of transporting\npassengers and freight. In particular, according to estimates by Gordon (1992), productivity in the\ncommercial airline industry rose 7 percent per year during the 1960s, well above the rate of labor\nproductivity growth for the economy as a whole.21\nFor purposes of comparison, the technological origins of the more recent computer revolution also\nbear a brief mention. Obviously, the invention of the transistor and the development of the mainframe\ncomputer were precursors of the technological advances that contributed to the current productivity\nboom. However, the real drivers of the productivity gains in the 1990s were the related high-tech\ninnovations of the 1970s and 1980s, including the personal computer, fiber optics, wireless\ncommunications, and the Internet.\nMany of the recent technological innovations have significantly altered how firms interact with their\ncustomers, in ways that have raised the productivity of the economy. In the retail sector, the Internet\nstores made popular by Amazon.com have been adopted by nearly all large retail chains; in banking, it\nis now routine for customers to pay bills online; and for airlines, Internet reservations and e-tickets are\nthe norm. Moreover, throughout the goods economy, from manufacturing to retailing, innovations in\ninventory management practices made possible by new technologies have substantially reduced\ncosts.\nAn important point about technological change is that, in most cases, the invention of the technologies\nthat stimulated the productivity growth in these boom periods took place well before the productivity\ngains were realized. For example, the steam engine was invented in the 1700s, well before it had any\nmeasurable effect on the production process in the United States. Similarly, railroads were being built\nin the 1840s, and the first electric power plant was built in 1882. And as we all know, the absence of a\nsignificant contribution to productivity growth from computers, which were first introduced in 1945, was\na puzzle to many economists as late as the mid-1990s.\nWhat then facilitated the translation of these innovations into gains in productivity? At one level, the\ndelay reflected the challenges of developing commercial applications for the new technologies. The\nlag from a new invention to a new product or process was sometimes quite long because of the\nadditional scientific research required to demonstrate its practicality. In addition, in many cases, new\ntechnologies diffused into the capital stock relatively slowly. Replacing older machines with equipment\nthat embodied the new technologies was often not immediately profitable, and thus firms frequently\ntook some time before making the capital investments required to take full advantage of technological\nprogress.\nSources of past productivity booms: organizational change\nA careful examination of past productivity booms also points to substantial changes in business\npractices and in the organization of firms as a key factor enabling businesses to achieve the potential\nproductivity gains associated with new technologies.22 In many cases, these organizational changes\nwent hand in hand with the technological advances - the changes both being made possible by the\nnew technologies and being necessary to achieve the additional productivity associated with the use\nof these technologies.\nFor example, before the Civil War, most businesses were either sole proprietorships or partnerships\nserving local markets and consisted of small shops employing skilled workers involved in each aspect\nof the production process. At the same time that the spread of railroads lowered transportation costs\nand increased the size and number of potential markets, the greater availability of steam power\nenabled manufacturers to set up factories to take advantage of economies of scale in production. As a\nresult, the optimal firm size rose substantially in many industries. In the cotton industry, for example,\nthe median firm size (measured as the annual value of gross production in 1860 dollars) rose from\n$31,000 in 1850 to nearly $100,000 in 1870; similarly, in the iron industry, median firm size rose from\n$24,000 in 1850 to more than $200,000 in 1870.23 In addition, large wholesalers (and later, retailers)\nemerged to take advantage of increased distributional efficiencies to sharply reduce the costs of\nmoving commodities and manufactured goods from the farm or factory to retailers' shelves.\nThese larger enterprises typically had to confront communications challenges not faced by smaller\nbusinesses. In particular, effective internal information flows were often crucial to the success of firms\nproducing or distributing large volumes of inputs and outputs. The telegraph and the railroad-based\npostal service made prompt communication over great distances possible. But firms also had to set up\nhierarchical management systems to control the production process and to coordinate the flow of\ngoods across the distribution system in order to take advantage of the economies of scale presented\nby technological change.\nAdvances in production processes in the early 1900s led to new challenges and opportunities for\nbusiness organization. As noted above, the diffusion of the electric motor throughout the factory\nincreased the use of continuous-process methods and the assembly line and thus accelerated the\ntrend toward mass production. In addition, as early as the 1880s, manufacturers had begun to\nintegrate forward into distribution; one noteworthy example was the meatpacking industry, in which\nfirms purchased refrigerated rail cars that allowed shipment of beef from centralized slaughterhouses\nto branch houses that served local markets. The advances in mass production techniques and the\nincreasing complexity of many manufactured products led firms in other industries to integrate forward\nnot only into distribution but also into retailing; this vertical integration reduced transactions costs even\nmore and further increased the optimal size of firms. Indeed, many of the large corporations that arose\nat this time - Ford, General Motors, and General Electric, for example - are still with us today.\nThe vertical integration of these large corporations, in turn, led to a greater emphasis on\nnonproduction activities.24 To compete in retail markets, firms needed to understand what products\nconsumers wanted and to enable consumers to associate specific products with a particular firm; in\naddition, firms needed to establish accounting systems to keep track of a wider range of activities. As\na result, marketing and advertising departments arose within large corporations, as did accounting\ndepartments. Also, with large corporations now more sensitive to their market share and their cost\nadvantage over their competitors, they began to develop applied research departments to foster\ninnovations in their industries.\nAfter World War II, changes in the organization of the firm took two forms. The first was an increasing\ntendency by corporate managers to split the firms' operations into separate divisions, each with its\nown manufacturing and marketing departments. This multidivisional approach was well suited to the\ntechnological changes of the 1940s and 1950s, as many innovations during that period led to the\nmanufacturing of diverse product lines by a single company, DuPont and Monsanto being key\nexamples.25\nThis multidivisional structure also turned out to be an effective method of handling corporate\noperations in different geographic areas; and indeed, the second major organizational innovation\nduring this period was the rise of the multinational corporation. After World War II, new trade\nagreements and efforts to revitalize Europe and Japan allowed American firms to make significant\ninroads into foreign markets. To handle these long-distance operations more easily, corporations often\nset up foreign subsidiaries that could adapt quickly to changing circumstances in the host country's\nmarketplace. By one estimate, such multinational corporations accounted for nearly 35 percent of total\nU.S. corporate assets by 1966.26\nOrganizational structure during the productivity boom of the late 1990s has, in some respects, shifted\naway from the large corporations that dominated the U.S. economy during much of the twentieth\ncentury. To be sure, the marketplace in many industries is still dominated by large, well-established\nfirms. And in some industries - the financial services sector comes to mind - recent technological\ninnovations have, if anything, increased the scale of business. But in other industries, intense global\ncompetition has motivated many corporations to narrow their focus to core production-related activities\nand to outsource other functions. Increasingly, these supporting firms are providing their services from\noverseas, taking advantage both of lower labor costs there and of the revolution in communications.\nAt the same time, much of the rapid technological innovation in this period has occurred outside the\nlarge corporate sector, and the success of that innovation has boosted the pace at which new\nventures are being created. For example, more than 700,000 new businesses were incorporated each\nyear, on average, in the 1990s, about double the pace of the 1970s.27 Of course, as we know from the\ndot-com experience, many of these firms failed. However, many others either grew or were bought by\nlarger firms better able to market and distribute the most promising innovations.\nSources of past productivity booms: financial market change\nA third major ingredient in promoting the productivity gains associated with technological innovation\nhas been a complementary set of innovations in the financial sector that have changed the financial\nlandscape in ways that were especially appropriate to the predominate form of business organization\nin each period.28\nFor example, before the Civil War, most nonfinancial business investment was financed internally with\nretained earnings, with capital provided by family or friends, or through partnerships formed with other\nproprietors. The chief exceptions were the canals and railroads, which were actively issuing stocks\nand bonds in the 1850s.29 With the need for greater capital investments and the sharp increases in the\nscale of operations of many firms after the Civil War, however, businesses in other industries also\nbegan to look more toward external sources of financing.\nThe main sources of funding in the decades after the Civil War were debt and preferred stock.30 Debt\noften took the form of secured loans, in large part because investors were concerned about the\ninformational asymmetries they faced in evaluating the bankruptcy risk of particular firms. In addition,\nthe owners of many firms often preferred financing with debt rather than common stock because they\ndid not want to see their equity diluted or their control of the enterprise diminished. Similarly, preferred\nstock, which reduced bankruptcy risk but did not dilute the equity of the owners of the firm, was often\nused when assets were insufficient to secure the loan. Thus, despite the prevalence of information\nproblems, financial intermediaries were able to provide firms with external sources of funds, making\npossible the rapid buildup in the capital stock that took place in the late 1800s. For example, the total\nvalue of bank loans rose from less than $1 billion in 1870 to more than $6 billion in the early 1890s, a\nnotable increase in nominal value during a time when, if anything, the aggregate price level was\nfalling.31\nIn contrast, the years after World War I were characterized by an increase in the importance of equity\nmarkets. At the New York Stock Exchange alone, the volume of stock sales rose from 186 million\nshares in 1917 to more than 1 billion shares in 1929.32 And, by one estimate, the number of individuals\nholding stock increased from 500,000 in 1900 to 10 million by 1930.33\nThe rise in the public's interest in common stock occurred for several reasons. First, and probably\nmost importantly, the profitability of large corporations during the early 1900s was accompanied by an\nexpanding middle and upper class that wanted to take part in the economic gains associated with the\nintroduction of new technologies such as the internal combustion engine and the electric motor. As the\nmain way to share in these capital gains was to purchase some ownership in those corporations,\nthese individuals increasingly looked to invest their savings in the stock market.\nAt about the same time, the informational problems that had constrained interest in common stock\nthrough the early 1900s were being reduced. Rising demand from investors in the late 1800s for\ninformation about railroad companies had led to the proliferation of newsletters watching\ndevelopments in that industry, and similar publications soon sprang up to provide information on other\ntraded securities. These newsletters eventually evolved into ratings agencies covering a wide range of\nindividual corporations, with Moody's issuing the first bond ratings in 1909. Although these agencies'\nratings focused on corporate bond issues, many also provided economic forecasting services and\nmore detailed information about the relative risk of specific companies. In addition, with a greater\nrecognition of the need to address investors' concerns about risk, more public companies regularly\nissued audited financial statements.34\nInterest in common stock was also boosted by the tendency to imbue them with characteristics similar\nto those associated with debt, with which investors were more familiar. For example, businesses\nfrequently attempted to establish steady dividend streams in order to boost investors' confidence\nabout the future profitability of the firm and encourage holdings of their securities. Finally, the\nmarketing of securities to the household sector became more aggressive in the 1920s, led by\ninvestment trusts - which offered investors a means of diversifying individual portfolios - and retail\nbrokerage firms.\nGiven the relative prosperity of the post-World War II period, nonfinancial corporations were able to\ngenerate significant increases in internal funds. Even so, the growth of investment spending over this\nperiod noticeably outpaced the rise in retained earnings, and thus these corporations turned to the\ncapital markets to fill the widening gap. In response, both bond and equity issuance rose rapidly in\nabsolute terms, and the ratio of external financing to overall capital spending increased from an\naverage of around 30 percent in the late 1940s to more than 40 percent in the early 1970s.35\nThere were two specific developments in financial markets during this period that bear mentioning.\nFirst, the late 1950s and 1960s saw the rise of the Eurodollar market - a market for U.S. dollar\ndeposits and loans outside the United States, and at least initially in Europe. Although the origin and\nearly development of the Eurodollar market is attributed, in part, to a desire by holders of dollars to\navoid U.S. regulations, including the Regulation Q interest rate ceilings, that market subsequently\nbecame a useful source of short-term financing - complementary to the commercial paper market - for\nlarge corporations seeking alternatives to more costly domestic commercial bank loans.36 Second, the\n1950s and 1960s were characterized by a sharp rise in the importance of large institutional investors -\nespecially pension funds - in the stock and bond markets. This rise, coupled with the growth of mutual\nfunds and brokerage houses, enabled smaller investors (either explicitly or implicitly) to further\ndiversify their portfolios.\nMore recently, financial markets have continued to evolve to meet the financing needs of the business\nsector and the concerns of investors. In particular, in response to the proliferation of start-up\nbusinesses and, for many firms, a riskier economic environment, financial intermediaries have\nexpanded the range of financing alternatives available to businesses and have made marked\nimprovements in quantifying and managing risk.\nFor larger lower-rated corporations that have significant default risk, the expansion of the so-called\njunk bond market has offered the capability to raise funds even when other sources of financing were\nless available. For example, junk bond issuance rose from about $11 billion in 1984 to more than\n$100 billion in 2001, while the par value of outstanding junk-rated debt has increased from less than\n$100 billion in the mid 1980s to nearly $700 billion today.37\nFor smaller and yet-riskier firms, venture capital and initial public offerings have been important\nsources of financing. For example, venture capital investments, which were negligible in the early\n1980s, rose to more than $100 billion in 2000, although they have since dropped back.38 Similarly,\ninitial public offerings for nonfinancial companies (excluding spinoffs and leveraged buyouts) exploded\nfrom less than $5 billion per year in the late 1980s to roughly $30 billion in 2000.39\nIn terms of managing risk, many large financial institutions have, over the past decade, increasingly\nadopted internal credit-risk models to improve their ability to assess in real time the riskiness of their\nportfolios. In addition, financial-market innovations, including securitizations, credit derivatives, and an\nimproved secondary loan market, have allowed these institutions to better manage their exposure to\nsuch risks. These improvements in risk management may help to explain why financial institutions\nweathered the recent economic downturn so well relative to their difficulties in previous recessions.\nSources of past productivity booms: human capital accumulation\nThe fourth ingredient underlying the productivity booms of the past involves labor input-specifically, the\navailability of a workforce capable of bringing to fruition the possibilities opened up by the\ntechnological innovations. Technological advances have not increased the demand for all skill sets\nequally. For example, the shift in manufacturing production from artisanal shops in the mid-1800s to\nfactories after the Civil War led to a disproportionate increase in the demand for unskilled labor to\noperate the new machines. But, as I noted earlier, increases in the optimal size of firms and the growth\nof businesses dedicated to mass distribution and mass production also increased the demand for\nworkers who could perform clerical and managerial tasks. Indeed, the percent of men who were\nemployed in white-collar occupations rose from less than 5 percent in 1850 to nearly 18 percent by\n1900.40\nThe demand for white-collar workers continued to increase in the early twentieth century with the\nfurther expansion in corporate size and the new focus on activities outside traditional production. In\nparticular, these additional activities required a new set of managers to control and coordinate the\ndiverse functions of the corporation and an increase in clerical workers to process the increased flow\nof information associated with vertical integration. As a result, nonproduction workers as a share of the\ntotal labor force rose from 6-1/2 percent in 1880 to nearly 25 percent by 1930.41\nMoreover, contrary to what had been true earlier, manufacturing firms that were using more advanced\ntechnologies in the early 1900s also tended to hire more-capable and more highly educated workers.\nIn particular, in the 1920s, the industries that were more likely to employ high-school-educated\nbluecollar workers tended to be the same industries that were further along in adopting the new\ntechnologies, suggesting that the basic reading and mathematics skills acquired in high schools were\nvalued by firms in these industries. That wage levels in these industries tended to be higher than for\nthe manufacturing sector as a whole is a further indication that they employed workers with more\nskills.42\nSimilarly, throughout the rest of the twentieth century, skilled labor and new technologies appeared to\nbe complements in production. The 1950s and 1960s saw a significant increase in the share of the\nworkforce in professional and technical occupations, with especially rapid growth among engineers\nand technicians.43 And the 1980s and 1990s saw a rise in the wage premium for higher-skilled\nworkers, as well as a sharp increase in the demand for workers with computer-related skills. In\ncontrast, lower-skilled workers have suffered in recent years from competitive pressures that are\nrelated in part to the outsourcing of low-skilled jobs abroad.\nThe institution of universal education in the United States has allowed our workforce to adapt to the\nchanging skill requirements of the economy. In the late 1800s, school enrollment rates among children\nheld steady at about 50 percent and high school graduation rates remained below 5 percent, a pattern\nconsistent with the absence of a significant wage premium for educated labor. However, as the\npremium for education widened in the early 1900s, enrollment rates in secondary schools increased\nsteadily, and the high school graduation rate rose to more than 25 percent by the late 1920s. Similarly,\npartly reflecting rising demand for college-educated labor in the 1950s and 1960s, the percentage of\n18 to 24 year olds enrolled in college rose from about 14 percent in 1950 to roughly 25 percent in\n1970.44\nAfter stagnating in the 1970s and 1980s, college enrollment rates among youths began to rise again in\nthe 1990s, reflecting a further widening in the skill premium for workers with a college degree.\nMoreover, enrollments at community colleges increased about 30 percent between 1985 and 2000,\nand the percent of adults attending an education program rose from 33 percent in 1991 to 45 percent\nin 1999, with a particularly large increase evident for the unemployed.45 These changes likely reflect,\nin part, efforts by lesser-skilled adults to retool their skills.\nIn sum, the productivity booms of the past seem to have involved four key ingredients: technological\ninnovation; the willingness and ability of owners and corporate managers to reengineer the internal\norganization of their firms to take maximum advantage of those innovations; complementary\ninnovations in the financial sectors specifically tailored to the forms of business organization\npredominating at the time; and the availability of a workforce sufficiently educated to actualize the\npotential implicit in the technological innovations. From the standpoint of economic policy, we\nundoubtedly stand to learn a number of valuable lessons from these similarities, but let me touch on a\nfew that I think are particularly important.\nLessons from past productivity booms\nFirst, many of the technological innovations associated with past productivity booms were general\npurpose technologies (GPTs) with widespread applicability. Such technologies have operated through\na variety of channels, raising productivity not only in production, but also in distribution and business\npractices. In many cases - railroads and computers, for example - the productivity improvements were\ninitially most pronounced in the production of the capital equipment embodying the new technologies.\nIn particular, Fishlow (1966) estimates that multifactor productivity in the railroad industry rose nearly\n4 percent per year, on average, between 1840 and 1900, as compared with increases of around\n1 percent per year for the economy as a whole. And, Oliner and Sichel (2002) estimate that since\n1990, efficiency gains in the production of high-tech equipment have accounted for about half of\noverall multifactor productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector. In addition, such general\npurpose technologies typically draw in substantial amounts of new investment capital. For example,\nFishlow (2000) points out that in the 1870s, investment in transportation facilities amounted to more\nthan 15 percent of capital formation. Similarly, in 2003, investment in high-tech equipment as a share\nof overall business fixed investment stood at 42 percent, up from 19 percent in 1980.46\nThe importance of general purpose technologies raises the question of whether governments should\nattempt to stimulate the development of particular GPTs, perhaps through some type of industrial\npolicy. To be sure, government intervention has, at times, contributed to specific technological\ninnovations. Government support in the 1800s - through federal land grants and state and local aid -\nwas one source of financing for railway construction in the 1850s and after the Civil War. Military\nsupport for chemical research that focused on developing new materials during World War II obviously\ncontributed to productivity gains in the private sector in the 1950s and 1960s. And, the Department of\nDefense supported the development in the 1960s of the ARPANET, the predecessor of the Internet of\ntoday.\nHowever, many, if not most, of the general purpose technologies of the past two centuries have had\ntheir genesis in the private sector. The steam engine, the electric motor, and the computer were\ndeveloped and diffused through the economy largely as a result of the profit opportunities afforded by\nthose new technologies. And, even for railroads, external financing came primarily from private\ndomestic or foreign sources; estimates place the proportion of government funding in nominal\ninvestment by railroad companies at less than 10 percent after the Civil War.47\nIn the United States, the government has contributed most effectively to technological change by\npromoting an economic, financial, and legal environment that is conducive to innovation and to the\ndiffusion of new technologies. Federal funding of basic research, often in research universities or\nfederal laboratories, obviously comprises an important part of this contribution. However, another key\ncomponent of this environment has been the protection of intellectual property rights. Patent laws in\nthe United States have encouraged innovation by attempting to strike a careful balance - allowing the\ninventors of new technologies to reap the benefits of their innovations, while at the same time\nencouraging the timely diffusion of new technologies and limiting the damage from monopoly power.48\nIn the past, patent laws have primarily emphasized protection of the new technologies or production\nprocesses associated with invention. Given that recent innovations have, to an increasing extent,\nencompassed the transformation of electronic data to create new methods of business practices, the\nchallenge today is to ensure that such innovations are afforded the appropriate degree of protection -\nensuring that innovators are rewarded for their ideas but not granting them so wide a range of territory\nin the property-rights battlefield that they acquire a stranglehold on the economy and, perversely, are\nallowed to choke off the innovation that they helped create.49\nSimilarly, allowing businesses the flexibility to reorganize their operations in ways that permitted them\nto take maximum advantage of new technologies has been instrumental in translating technological\ninnovations into higher productivity in all four episodes. Likewise, U.S. labor markets have been quite\neffective at reallocating the workforce in response to technological changes. Of course, some\ngovernment regulation of business and labor markets is absolutely essential, but such regulatory\npolicies must be designed taking account not only of perceived advantages but also of economic\ncosts. For example, it seems clear in retrospect that the deregulation of a number of industries in the\n1970s and 1980s, such as airlines, trucking, financial services, and natural gas, ultimately provided an\nimportant boost to productivity growth by allowing businesses in those industries to operate with fewer\nconstraints and more flexibility.50\n46\nFishlow (2000) and Mowery and Rosenberg (2000) also note the importance of intersectoral linkages between new\ntechnologies and other industries. In the nineteenth century, for example, the construction of railroads had backward\nlinkages to the coal, iron and steel, and machinery industries and forward linkages to the distribution sector. Likewise, in the\ntwentieth century, the innovations in electricity, chemistry, and the development of the internal combustion engine led both\nto widespread productivity improvements in mature industries and the creation of new industries.\n47\nFishlow (2000).\n48\nEngerman and Sokoloff (2000). Some observers have also emphasized that technological diffusion can be effectively\nachieved through the sharing of information or collective invention. See Meyer (2003), who points to the technological\nimprovements in steel production in the 1800s and in personal computers in the 1970s as examples of such networking\ngains.\n49\nFor a discussion of patent policy in the context of financial market innovations, see Ferguson (2003).\n50\nSee Winston (1998) for a summary of the evidence.\nBIS Review 1/2004\nIn a different vein, one must note the ongoing debate about whether protectionist measures - such as\ntariffs and quotas - might also be helpful in raising long-run productivity growth by encouraging the\ndiffusion of new technologies into the domestic capital stock. For example, the tariffs that protected\ndomestic markets from foreign competition in the 1800s are viewed by some observers as having\nprovided manufacturers the opportunity to expand more rapidly.51 However, even then, the American\neconomy benefited considerably from free trade in intellectual property by exploiting technologies that\nhad been invented abroad. Moreover, the experience of other periods of American history\ndemonstrates that protectionist measures are not an effective means of promoting the diffusion of\ntechnology in a more developed economy. The detrimental economic effects associated with the\npassage of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs in 1930 provide one important example. And, in the post-World\nWar II period, the relaxation of trade restrictions opened up important foreign markets to the new\nproducts being developed by U.S. corporations. More generally, the United States has, over time,\nconsistently and successfully responded to competitive pressures from abroad, often through\ntechnological innovations that create new markets and opportunities.\nAnother lesson from past productivity booms is that the willingness of investors to hold securities is\ncrucial for firms to raise the working capital they need to take advantage of the productivity potential of\nnew technologies. For instance, as I noted earlier, the information problems of the late 1800s and\nearly 1900s constrained interest in common stock, and this reluctance by investors to hold equity\npresumably raised the overall cost of capital. Similarly, unless the corporate governance issues of the\npast few years are aggressively addressed, the damage to the financial intermediation process will\nundoubtedly result in a higher cost of capital. In this regard, prudent regulation of financial markets is\nextremely important, and a crucial aspect of this regulation has been the requirement that firms\nprovide information that is extensive, accurate, and interpretable in a straightforward manner.\nGovernment involvement in providing broad access to education has also played an important role in\nstimulating economic growth by continually improving the ability of the workforce to adapt to technical\nchange. In the past, a basic facility for reading and arithmetic were essential to workers in a wide\nrange of occupational settings, and American schools effectively provided these skills to our youths. In\nthe economy of the future, the educational requirements of the population will be even greater. Not\nonly will workers need basic skills in math and language, but they also will increasingly require\nknowledge of basic and applied science - as well as the ability to acquire new skills when required by\ntheir jobs. As a result, continued public recognition of the value of education as well as ongoing efforts\nto ensure widespread access to a high caliber of schooling at all levels will be indispensable.\nOf course, I would be remiss if I did not also comment on the importance of sound macroeconomic\npolicies in promoting long-run economic growth. Evidence clearly points to a correlation between low\ninflation and strong productivity growth. And while it is difficult to identify a strong causal relationship\nbetween a healthy economy and productivity, a couple of casual empirical observations are suggestive\nof a link. First, the number of patent applications tends to be higher in good economic times than\nduring recessions.52 If patenting is a valid measure of technological change, such a correlation\nsuggests that innovation is stimulated by healthy economic conditions. Second, and perhaps more\nimportant, business fixed investment - and thus the diffusion of new technologies through renewal of\nthe capital stock - is likely to be better maintained in an economic environment characterized by the\nrobust profit opportunities and lower uncertainties afforded by sustainable economic growth and low\ninflation.\nWhy do productivity booms end?\nTo complete my discussion, I want to turn briefly to the question of why periods of strong trend\nproductivity growth come to an end. Several hypotheses have been put forth, including (1) that\nsuccessful new technologies eventually lead to financial imbalances and overinvestment associated\nwith excess optimism, (2) that periods of strong productivity growth eventually run out of steam as the\nproductivity - increasing opportunities associated with new technologies are exhausted, and (3) that\nexogenous shocks bring an end to boom periods.\nAlthough elements of these three hypotheses can be seen in the past episodes of productivity booms,\nno clear pattern emerges. Regarding the first hypothesis, support can be found in the soaring stock\nprices of the late 1870s, the 1920s and the late 1990s, which in all three cases were coincident with a\nperiod of very rapid productivity growth and were followed (eventually) in the first two cases by a\ncollapse in stock prices and economic depression. In contrast, the steady rise in equity values during\nthe 1960s did not appear to be associated with the emergence of any significant financial imbalance,\nand the subsequent decline in stock prices in the mid-1970s may owe importantly to the failure of\neconomic policy to react to the changing dynamics of the economy and thus to control inflation.\nSimilarly, in certain industries - most notably automobiles and electric utilities - a speculative rise in\ncapital spending during the 1920s arguably did result in a significant overbuilding of capacity by the\nend of that decade. But such instances are more difficult to find in the late 1800s and in the 1960s.\nAnd, while there does appear to have been an overinvestment in high-tech and telecommunications\nequipment in the late 1990s, the recent productivity data certainly do not suggest that this\noverinvestment has ended the current productivity boom.\nThe hypothesis that productivity booms end when innovation and technical change levels off is difficult\nto test for the 1800s and early 1900s because of a lack of data. Arguments along this line, which\nsurfaced to explain the productivity slowdown of the 1970s, pointed to the deceleration in the growth of\nresearch and development (R&D) spending in the late 1960s as evidence. However, Griliches (1988)\nhas argued convincingly that this shortfall in R&D spending was not of sufficient magnitude to\ncontribute very much to the productivity slowdown. But, even if the notion that technological\ninnovations are eventually exhausted is valid, we have no evidence that this is as yet a significant risk\nto the current productivity boom. Both industrial R&D and patent applications have risen rapidly in\nrecent years, suggesting that innovation - and the potential productivity gains associated with\ntechnological progress - will likely remain an important source of economic growth in the United States\nin coming years.\nFinally, some role for exogenous shocks is also evident in past episodes, depending on how broadly\none defines an exogenous shock. The 1973 oil shock is perhaps is the most convincing example,\nalthough the extent to which this ended the \"golden era\" is still the subject of much discussion. In\naddition, the bank panic of 1893 is viewed by some as an important contributor to the depression of\nthe 1890s; however, whether this event is an exogenous shock or an indication of earlier economic\nexcess (as in 1929) is debatable. Of course, we have also experienced significant exogenous shocks\nin recent years - including 9/11, the Iraq conflict, and a variety of corporate scandals. It is encouraging\nthat the economy seems to have successfully weathered these recent shocks with no significant harm\nto productivity growth.\nConclusion\nAll of us as government economists, policymakers, and citizens have a stake in learning the lessons\nfrom past productivity booms. As I have said, productivity improvements translate directly into\nimprovements in the standard of living. Economists will continue to debate the relative importance of\nvarious factors underlying productivity growth. But our experience in the United States clearly\nsuggests that periods of relatively rapid trend productivity growth are characterized by innovations in\ntechnology that are accompanied by changes in organizational structure and in business financing\narrangements and by investments in human capital. Productivity booms in the United States have\nbeen of varying duration, but we have seen two of them last as long as twenty years. We do not know\ndefinitively what brings these booms to an end. In our experience, however, periods of elevated\nincreases in trend productivity are best fostered in an environment of economic and personal freedom\nand government policies that are focused on erecting sound and stable macroeconomic conditions\nthat are most conducive to private-sector initiative.\nUS Productivity growth, 1873-2003\n(Average annual percent change)\nCapital deepening and\nPeriod Labor Multifactor\nother1\n1873-2003 2.02 1.33 0.73\nEpisode I\n1873-90 2.6 0.9 1.7\n1890-1917 1.5 0.8 0.7\nEpisode II\n1917-27 3.8 2.8 1.0\n1927-48 1.8 1.7 0.1\nEpisode III\n1948-73 2.9 1.9 1.0\n1973-95 1.4 0.4 1.0\nEpisode IV\n1995-2003 2.92 1.03 1.63\n1 2 3\nIncludes changes in labor composition.

         "Donald L Kohn: The United States in the world economy\nSpeech by Mr Donald L Kohn, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System,\nat the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's Public Policy Dinner, Atlanta, Georgia, 7 January 2004.\n* * *\nNo public policy issues facing the United States today in the economic realm are more important or\nprominent than those that touch on our place in the world economy. The greater attention to global\neconomic issues is partly just a natural byproduct of the increasing interdependencies of all national\neconomies. But this focus has been accentuated of late by the potential effects of two trends that have\nintensified in recent years. One is the emergence of several developing countries - most prominently\nChina and India - as global economic forces and the consequent reorganization of production\nprocesses and change in the nature and location of jobs here and abroad. The second is our\nburgeoning trade and current account deficits and the possibility that they cannot be sustained at\nthese levels. Like most interesting policy issues, these are difficult and complex, and they therefore\ncarry a considerable risk that policy prescriptions will be ineffective or even counterproductive.1\nThe two developments are related, but only to a limited and indirect extent. Importantly, they arise\nfrom very different underlying sources. Job reorganization results from the integration of China and\nother developing countries into the world economy. The increase in our current account deficit has\nnumerous roots, including, most prominently, stronger growth here than in our trading partners. But\ntrade and exchange rate relationships with emerging-market economies are a small part of the story.\nThe deficit does mean that the United States has been spending more than we produce, and the rest\nof the world has done the opposite.\nBecause they have different causes, these developments have different public policy implications.\nTheir implications for Federal Reserve policy are indirect. We cannot affect the pace of job\nrestructuring nor correct the current account deficit, and that limitation is important to understand.\nNonetheless, how these phenomena evolve and how they are addressed are critical background\nfactors for us as we conduct monetary policy. They can influence the balance of aggregate supply and\ndemand and the functioning of the economy - its flexibility and resiliency and its capacity to advance\nstandards of living.\nLet's look at these developments separately.\nJob restructuring\nI think it is useful to look at job restructuring as the adaptation to a much larger development - a huge\nincrease in global productive capacity.\nThe major increase in global productivity has two main causes. The first is the spreading recognition in\nrecent decades, reinforced by the collapse of the Soviet Union, that market economies work best - that\nresponses to market signals by private parties trying to make profits and raise standards of living are\nfar more effective and efficient than government-directed allocation of resources. Hence not only\ncountries in Eastern Europe, where governments were overturned, but also China and India, where\npolitical stability has been maintained, have been shifting toward economic systems that place greater\nreliance on market transactions among private parties. This trend is unleashing huge productive\npotential.\nThe shift to market-based systems has been interacting with a second force - a heightened pace of\ntechnological change, especially the declining cost of generating and transmitting information. We can\nsee the effects of technological change here at home, where it has considerably boosted the growth\nrate of productivity since the mid-1990s. Globally, cheaper access to more information has eased the\nintegration and coordination of geographically diverse production processes. This development has\nopened up opportunities to transfer production to locations in which the work can be accomplished\nless expensively, and the trend toward market-based economies has multiplied the number of feasible\nlocations.\nThis type of shifting has been occurring in manufacturing for a long time in response to technical\ninnovation and economic development. But what seems to be different is that, because of the new\napplications of information technology and telecommunications, an increasing variety of services that\nused to be attached to a particular business location can be carried out anywhere in the world. For\nexample, call centers have moved to India and elsewhere. Routine back office accounting work such\nas handling accounts receivable is also shifting overseas and becoming centralized for global\ncorporations. Many types of routine programming can be carried out around the clock, handed off from\ntime zone to time zone by e-mail.\nThe interaction of these forces has led to a major restructuring of production processes - at home and\nabroad - and a redistribution of these processes and associated jobs geographically around the globe.\nIt is a beneficial development that will raise standards of living everywhere. In the newly emerging\neconomies, of course, hundreds of millions of people now have a chance to escape grinding poverty.\nBut the benefits will be felt in the industrial world as well.\nWorkers in the United States and other advanced economies will need to shift toward industries\nspecializing in the types of goods and services we produce relatively more efficiently. Typically,\nproduction of these goods and services involve more complex processes, often those that are more\nrooted in the higher knowledge and skills of our workers. As workers shift to higher value-added\nemployment, real wages will rise commensurately.\nIn addition, U.S. residents are getting access to less costly goods produced abroad. As a\nconsequence, more toys appeared under the Christmas tree, and we have a greater choice of\ninexpensive clothes. I would guess that the less well-off among us probably benefit disproportionately\nfrom the availability of many of the types of less-expensive goods coming in from abroad. They are\nbetter able to clothe and feed their families and have more income available for other necessities,\nsuch as housing and medical care.\nInternational trade is not a zero sum game in which one country's gains are another country's loss. By\nspecializing in what they do best, workers in all countries can be winners. Even if one country can be\nmore efficient at producing all goods and services than another, each will gain by specializing in what\nit does relatively better. This is the result of what economists call comparative advantage. Increased\ntrade should redistribute jobs, but it should not create or destroy jobs in the aggregate over the long\nrun. Long-run levels of employment are determined by the available supply of labor and the flexibility\nof the labor market. Keeping employment reasonably close to its long-term, sustainable level is the job\nof macroeconomic policy - especially monetary policy.\nTo be sure, individuals do get hurt in the transition, but within a country gains should exceed losses\nover the longer run. Unfortunately, from a political perspective, the gains are often widely disbursed,\naccrue over time, and are hard to measure whereas the losses are concentrated and palpable. Those\nwhose jobs are restructured face a difficult adjustment. Even if it is possible, climbing the value-added\nchain may not be easy, and the dislocations are costly for those involved. People often are\nunemployed for a considerable time, and a significant portion end up settling for jobs that pay less\nthan the one they left. Trying to protect those particular jobs through tariffs or quotas on imported\ngoods may help those workers who face loss, but that protection will likely prove temporary and will\nreduce the standard of living for the country as a whole.\nWhen considering public policy responses to job restructuring, we must keep the pace of change in\nperspective and remember the flexibility and resiliency of our labor and product markets. Indeed,\neconomists cannot even agree on whether job restructuring has accelerated. One study finds that,\nsince the early 1980s, job loss has had a much larger structural component; another study fails to find\nany such trend.2 Manufacturing employment has been in a long-term downtrend for decades, likely\nbecause of the substantial advances in productivity as well as the rising preference for services in an\nincreasingly wealthy country. We should also recall that the shifting of some jobs to Japan in the\n1980s and to East Asia and Mexico in the 1990s aroused considerable concern. These developments\ndid not prevent a drop in the unemployment rate to a thirty-year low in the late 1990s. Moreover, the\nnew jobs have not been lower paying. Higher productivity growth has meant that, on average, real\nwages and compensation rose substantially in the second half of the 1990s and have continued to\nincrease in the past few years, albeit more slowly, despite the recent recession and jobless recovery.\nOne difficulty of assessing trends in job restructuring in recent years has been the weak cyclical\nposition of the economy. We must not confuse nor conflate cyclical and structural issues, especially\nwhen thinking about policy implications. A lot of today's pain in manufacturing and in the overall\neconomy is cyclical - a consequence of inadequate demand, not of a shift of jobs to other countries.\nBecause this business cycle was led by capital goods both in its boom and bust stages, manufacturing\nhas been especially hard hit over the last few years. In fact, until the economy comes much closer to\nfull employment, we will not be able to isolate the structural issues with any confidence.\nAuthorities here and abroad have the tools to get economies back to high levels of employment and\nproduction, even as we adjust to higher productivity growth and shifting production processes. Getting\neconomies on track seems to be requiring unusually accommodative fiscal and monetary policies - but\nthese policies finally appear to be bearing fruit.\nIndeed, over time, high productivity growth here and rising productive capacity abroad can increase\ndemand for goods and services even more than they increase supply. We saw considerable strength\nin demand in the United States in the 1990s, when productivity accelerated, and we are beginning to\nsee it in China, where rising demand for imports is eroding the country's large trade surplus and\nboosting the economies of some of its trading partners. People experiencing much brighter economic\nprospects will want much more in the way of consumer goods. Businesses here and in China will need\ncapital equipment to expand, and no country does a better job of producing sophisticated capital\nequipment than does the United States.\nThe key to easing adjustment for the individuals affected is training and education. We must do a\nbetter job of giving our current workers and the next generations the skills needed to grab the highly\nproductive, knowledge-based jobs to which demand will continue to shift. I cannot tell you exactly in\nwhat sectors or industries these jobs will be; government is not good at picking winners and losers.\nThe market system will sort that out and, in the process, will signal our workers as to which skills are\nbecoming more highly valued. Government needs to make sure that the opportunities and resources\nare available for obtaining those skills.\nI recognize that, unfortunately, not every country always plays by the rules. Some job restructuring\noccurs not because of relative efficiencies but because of subsidies of certain industries or\ndiscrimination against foreign goods. We need to work together with all countries to eliminate\nimpediments, wherever they might be, to realizing the benefits of the global increase in productive\ncapacity.\nIt would be counterproductive to increase protectionist measures, which in effect would reduce the\nflexibility of our economy, lock people into inferior jobs, and end up raising costs for consumers -\nespecially those among us who can least afford to pay more.\nThe trade and current account deficits\nOur current account deficit has been growing both in dollar terms and relative to the size of our\neconomy, reaching 5 percent of GDP last year. This is a record for us; when the deficit approached\nthis magnitude in the past, markets had generally already begun to adjust to reduce it.3\nThe deficit reflects the fact that spending in the United States exceeds what we produce. We meet the\nextra demand by importing more than we export. We pay for the added imports by using the savings of\npeople in other countries - that is, they lend us money to buy their goods and services.\nUsing more goods and services than one produces is not a bad deal. We could do so indefinitely,\nprovided that foreigners were willing to continue increasing their loans and investments in the United\nStates. Even then, of course, we would have ever-rising debts to service, and foreigners would own a\ngrowing proportion of our capital stock. We have indeed become a large net debtor in global capital\nmarkets, but so far, the net servicing of the debt has been very small.\nFor quite a while, global investors seemed willing to increase the proportion of the total assets they\nhold as claims on the United States, denominated in dollars. Through the 1990s and into the early\n2000s foreigners expected returns here to be so high that they willingly sent us larger and larger\namounts of savings - in effect, financing a goodly part of our investment boom. The strong demand for\ndollar assets was evidenced by a rising exchange rate, which in turn fed the increase in the current\naccount and trade deficits.\nThis point is important to keep in mind. We did not seek to run a current account deficit, nor did we\nmake policy mistakes that brought it on. The current account and trade deficits became so large\nmostly because we had a more-dynamic, faster-growing economy than everyone else had - one with a\nhigher expected return on investment, which induced a rising demand for dollar claims on our\nincreasingly productive capital stock.\nBut although the U.S. economy continues to be far more vigorous than most others, foreign investors\nmay be becoming less willing to finance the gap between what we spend and what we produce. With\nthe current account deficit climbing, that gap is growing fast - evidently faster than the appetite for U.S.\nassets. Private capital flows into the United States have ceased expanding rapidly. Governments -\nespecially those of Japan and China - have taken up the slack by purchasing U.S. assets, but the\nshortfall in the desire to supply savings to fund our deficit has been reflected in a significant drop in the\ndollar on foreign exchange markets since early 2002.\nIt is to be expected, at least for economies with exchange rates that truly float, that a shortfall of\ndemand for a country's assets will be reflected at first primarily in the exchange rate. The lower\nexchange rate in turn stimulates exports and damps imports, and so the current account deficit and\nthe associated need for foreign capital are also reduced, matching the lower appetite of foreign\ninvestors.\nTo date, this adjustment process has not been a problem for the United States. Because we are\noperating with spare capacity in our factories and labor markets, higher exports and lower imports are\nfine. They help boost U.S. production to more fully utilize labor and capital and should not add to\nsustained inflation pressures, even with import prices moving a little higher and competitive pressure\non import-competing industries easing a bit.\nSome have feared that lagging demand for our assets would show up in lower prices for the assets\nthemselves - that is, in increases in bond yields and declines in equity prices - as well as in lower\nexchange rates. However, for the most part, these assets are traded in highly liquid markets, where\neven large decreases in demand can be accommodated with very small changes in prices. In such\nmarkets, interest rates and equity prices tend to reflect investors' perceptions of fundamentals such as\nexpected inflation, profits, risk, and real growth. In fact, over recent months, as the dollar has\ncontinued to drop, equity prices have risen, and yields on corporate bonds are unchanged to a little\nlower. To be sure, foreign authorities have acquired a large quantity of dollar assets, but their\npurchases tend to be concentrated in Treasury and agency securities, not in privately issued equity or\ndebt.4\nThe global economy does face a potential longer-term structural issue. If investors are reaching a\npoint at which assets denominated in U.S. dollars are becoming as large a share of their portfolios as\nthey see appropriate, our trade deficit will need to shrink. We will not be able to call so much on an\nincreasing share of world saving to finance our spending, and that spending will need to match our\nproduction much more closely. At the Federal Reserve we will continue to work to foster a full\nemployment level of production, one as high as the economy can generate on a sustainable,\nnoninflationary basis. Relative to that level of production, demand or spending in the United States will\nneed to be considerably more restrained on both domestic and foreign goods, and more U.S.\nproduction will need to be exported abroad. This fact - this implication of the simple arithmetic of\nsmaller trade and current account deficits - raises important policy questions for both the United States\nand the rest of the world.\nIn the United States the tough questions are just what kind of spending will feel the brunt of the\nrestraint and to what extent will production have to shift to accommodate a new mix of spending. In\nparticular, without added doses of foreign saving, we are going to need to generate more of our own if\nwe wish to fund high levels of business investment in capital goods and household purchases of new\nhouses and durable goods. If we do not increase our saving, investment will have to be cut back. We\ncan get that savings from the private sector by decreasing consumption relative to income or from the\npublic sector by decreasing spending relative to taxes.\nIn that context, the prospect of large federal government deficits stretching out into the future looks\nworrisome. In the second half of the 1990s, we had both foreign and government savings to finance\ninvestment; a few years from now we may have less of the former and none of the latter - indeed, the\ngovernment sector is projected to be a net user of savings not a net supplier. The fiscal stimulus of the\npast few years has been quite helpful in promoting recovery, but we do need to consider the\nlongerterm implications of the policies put in place.\nIf the fiscal path does not change, unless private savings rise considerably to compensate, interest\nrates will be higher than they otherwise would be to ration the scarcer savings, and we will have\nslower growth in the capital stock and in the number of houses and autos. Slower growth in the capital\nstock means slower growth in productivity and in our economic potential. Constraints on trend growth\nwould be a concern at any time, but they are especially so over the coming years. We are on the cusp\nof a wave of retirements, which will leave a smaller workforce to generate the goods and services\nthose of us looking forward to retirement will consume even as we contribute less and less to their\nproduction. We need to be saving and investing to build our economic potential and to alleviate the\nburden on our children and grandchildren.\nThis is not a task for monetary policy. In the long run, monetary policy cannot do anything about the\ncurrent account deficit or about the lack of savings from government policy or private choices. Our\nmanipulation of the overnight interest rate helps to keep the overall economy in balance - promoting\nprice stability and production at the economy's potential. But on the Federal Open Market Committee\nJack and I can do nothing to promote savings other than to provide a stable backdrop for private\ndecisions. Promoting savings is a job for fiscal and tax policy.\nIf our trade and current account deficits move toward balance, foreign economies will face the\nquestions of how to replace the demand that will no longer be coming from the United States and to\nreallocate production to a new mix of spending. The U. S. current account will not correct in isolation.\nThe United States has been, in effect, exporting its demand overseas, supporting economic activity in\nforeign economies by importing more goods and services than we export. If our imports fall and\nexports rise, just the opposite will occur in the rest of the world. As our domestic demand is restrained\nrelative to production, demand elsewhere will have to increase to foster global high employment.\nHow that is to be achieved is an open question: Structural reforms that improve the flexibility of the\nlabor force and production and that foster growth abroad are a desirable way to contribute to better\nglobal balance, but macroeconomic policy adjustments to promote more domestic demand may also\nbe required. It is simply not possible for all countries to enjoy stimulus from net exports; some\ncountries will need to be net importers, especially if the United States no longer fills that role. And so\nmy two issues become related. The development strategies of countries such as China and other\nAsian nations, to be successful, must be compatible with the pattern of adjustment in global demand\nthat is required by the consumption, saving, and investment decisions made by market participants\neverywhere.\nConclusion\nThe global economy seems to be facing major adjustments in several dimensions simultaneously.\nSuccessful adaptation to changing circumstances will require flexibility on several fronts. No one can\nanticipate how events will unfold - the evolving geography and technology of the production of goods\nand services, the shifting balances between spending and producing as current accounts change. My\nfear is that poorly formed diagnoses and incorrect policy prescriptions will have unintended adverse\nconsequences for our economy. Any elements of rigidity - in exchange rates, in labor and product\nmarkets, in quotas and tariffs on international trade - limit the channels through which the adjustment\nprocess can work. Rigidity concentrates stresses, increases the risk of market disruptions, impedes\neconomic resiliency, and limits the world's ability to realize the full potential of the rise in global\nproductivity to lift standards of living.",

         "Alan Greenspan: Globalisation\nRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, before the Bundesbank Lecture 2004, Berlin, 13 January 2004.\n* * *\nGlobalization has altered the economic frameworks of both developed and developing nations in ways\nthat are difficult to fully comprehend. Nonetheless, the largely unregulated global markets do clear\nand, with rare exceptions, appear to move effortlessly from one state of equilibrium to another. It is as\nthough an international version of Adam Smith's \"invisible hand\" is at work.\nOne key aspect of the recent globalization process is the apparent persistent rise in the dispersion of\ncurrent account balances. Although for the world as a whole the sum of surpluses must always match\nthe sum of deficits, the combined size of both, relative to global gross domestic product (GDP), has\ngrown markedly since the end of World War II. This trend is inherently sustainable unless some\ncountries build up deficits that are no longer capable of being financed. Many argue that this has\nbecome the case for America's large current account deficit.\nThere is no simple measure by which to judge the sustainability of either a string of current account\ndeficits or their consequence, a significant buildup in external claims that need to be serviced. In the\nend, the restraint on the size of tolerable U.S. imbalances in the global arena will likely be the\nreluctance of foreign country residents to accumulate additional debt and equity claims against U.S.\nresidents. By the end of 2003, net external claims on U.S. residents had risen to approximately\n25 percent of a year's GDP, still far less than net claims on many of our trading partners but rising at\nthe equivalent of 5 percentage points of GDP annually. However, without some notion of America's\ncapacity for raising cross-border debt, the sustainability of the current account deficit is difficult to\nestimate. That capacity is evidently, in part, a function of globalization since the apparent increase in\nour debt-raising capacity appears to be related to the reduced cost and increasing reach of\ninternational financial intermediation.\nThe significant reduction in global trade barriers over the past half century has contributed to a marked\nrise in the ratio of world trade to GDP and, accordingly, a rise in the ratio of imports to domestic\ndemand. But also evident is that the funding of trade has required, or at least has been associated\nwith, an even faster rise in external finance. Between 1980 and 2002, for example, the nominal dollar\nvalue of world imports rose 5-1/2 percent annually, while gross external liabilities, largely financial\nclaims also expressed in dollars, apparently rose nearly twice as fast.1\nThis observation does not reflect solely the sharp rise in the external liabilities of the United States that\nhas occurred since 1995. Excluding the United States, world imports rose about 2-3/4 percent\nannually from 1995 to 2002; external liabilities increased approximately 8 percent.\nLess-comprehensive data suggest that the ratio of global debt and equity claims to trade has been\nrising since at least the beginning of the post-World War II period, though apparently at a more modest\npace than in recent years.2\nFrom an accounting perspective, part of the increase in the ratio of world gross claims to trade in\nrecent years reflects the continued marked rise in tradable foreign currencies held by private firms as\nwell as a very significant buildup of international currency reserves of monetary authorities. Rising\nglobal wealth apparently has led to increased demand for diversification of portfolios by including\ngreater shares of assets denominated in foreign currencies.\nMore generally, technological advance and the spread of global financial deregulation has fostered a\nbroadening array of specialized financial products and institutions. The associated increased layers of\nintermediation in our financial systems make it easier to diversify and manage risk, thereby facilitating\nan ever-rising ratio of both domestic liabilities and assets to GDP and gross external liabilities to\ntrade.3 These trends seem unlikely to reverse, or even to slow materially, short of an improbable end\nto the expansion of financial intermediation that is being driven by cost-reducing technology.\nUptrends in the ratios of external liabilities or assets to trade, and therefore to GDP, can be shown to\nhave been associated with the widening dispersion in countries' ratios of trade and current account\nbalances to GDP to which I alluded earlier.4 A measure of that dispersion, the sum of the absolute\nvalues of the current account balances estimated from each country's gross domestic saving less\ngross domestic investment (the current account's algebraic equivalent), has been rising as a ratio to\naggregate GDP at an average annual rate of about 2 percent since 1970 for the OECD countries,\nwhich constitute four-fifths of world GDP.\nThe long-term increase in intermediation, by facilitating the financing of ever-wider current account\ndeficits and surpluses, has created an ever-larger class of investors who might be willing to hold\ncrossborder claims. To create liabilities, of course, implies a willingness of some private investors and\ngovernments to hold the equivalent increase in claims at market-determined asset prices. Indeed,\nwere it otherwise, the funding of liabilities would not be possible.\nWith the seeming willingness of foreigners to hold progressively greater amounts of cross-border\nclaims against U.S. residents, at what point do net claims (that is, gross claims less gross liabilities)\nagainst the United States become unsustainable and deficits decline? Presumably, a U.S. current\naccount deficit of 5 percent or more of GDP would not have been readily fundable a half-century ago\nor perhaps even a couple of decades ago.5 The ability to move that much of world saving to the United\nStates in response to relative rates of return would have been hindered by a far lower degree of\ninternational financial intermediation. Endeavoring to transfer the equivalent of 5 percent of U.S. GDP\nfrom foreign financial institutions and persons to the United States would presumably have induced\nchanges in the prices of assets that would have proved inhibiting.\n* * *\nThere is, for the moment, little evidence of stress in funding U.S. current account deficits. To be sure,\nthe real exchange rate for the dollar has, on balance, declined about 15 percent broadly and roughly\n25 percent against the major foreign currencies since early 2002. Yet inflation, the typical symptom of\na weak currency, appears quiescent. Indeed, inflation premiums embedded in long-term interest rates\napparently have fluctuated in a relatively narrow range since early 2002. More generally, the vast\nsavings transfer has occurred without measurable disruption to the balance of international finance.\nCertainly, euro area exporters have been under considerable pressure, but in recent months credit risk\nspreads have fallen, and equity prices have risen, throughout much of the global economy.\n* * *\n3\nFor the United States, for example, even excluding mortgage pools, the ratio of domestic liabilities to GDP rose at an annual\nrate of 2 percent between 1965 and 2002. For the United Kingdom, the ratio of domestic liabilities to GDP increased\n4 percent at an annual rate during the 1987-2002 period.\n4\nIf the rate of growth of external assets (and liabilities) exceeds, on average, the growth rate of world GDP, under a broad\nrange of circumstances the dispersion of the change in net external claims of trading countries must increase as a\npercentage of world GDP. But the change in net claims on a country, excluding currency valuation changes and capital\ngains and losses, is essentially the current account balance. Of necessity, of course, the consolidated world current account\nbalance remains at zero.\nTheoretically, if external assets and liabilities were always equal, implying a current account in balance, the ratio of liabilities\nto GDP could grow without limit. But in the complexities of the real world, if external assets fall short of liabilities for some\ncountries, net external liabilities will grow until they can no longer be effectively serviced. Well short of that point, market\nprices, interest rates, and exchange rates will slow, and then end, the funding of liability growth.\n5\nIt is true that estimates of the ratios of the current account to GDP for many countries in the nineteenth century are\nestimated to have been as large as, or larger, than we have experienced in recent years. However, the substantial net flows\nof capital financing for those earlier deficits were likely motivated in large part by specific major development projects (for\nexample, railroads) bearing high expected rates of return. By contrast, diversification appears to be a more salient\nmotivation for today's large net capital flows. Moreover, gross capital flows are believed to be considerably greater relative\nto GDP in recent years than in the nineteenth century. (See Alan M. Taylor, \"A Century of Current Account Dynamics,\"\nJournal of International Money and Finance, 2002, 725-48, and Maurice Obstfeld and Alan Taylor, \"Globalization and\nCapital Markets,\" NBER Working Paper 8846, March 2002.)\nBIS Review 3/2004\nTo date, the widening to record levels of the U.S. ratio of current account deficit to GDP has been, with\nthe exception of the dollar's exchange rate, seemingly uneventful. But I have little doubt that, should\nthe rise in the deficit continue, at some point in the future further adjustments will be set in motion that\nwill eventually slow and presumably reverse the rate of accumulation of net claims on U.S. residents.\nHow much further can international financial intermediation stretch the capacity of world finance to\nmove national savings across borders?\nA major inhibitor appears to be what economists call \"home bias.\" Virtually all our trading partners\nshare our inclination to invest a disproportionate percentage of domestic savings in domestic capital\nassets, irrespective of the differential rates of return. People seem to prefer to invest in familiar local\nbusinesses even where currency and country risks do not exist. For the United States, studies have\nshown that individual investors and even professional money managers have a slight preference for\ninvestments in their own communities and states. Trust, so crucial an aspect of investing, is most likely\nto be fostered by the familiarity of local communities. As a consequence, home bias will likely continue\nto constrain the movement of world savings into its optimum use as capital investment, thus limiting\nthe internationalization of financial intermediation and hence the growth of external assets and\nliabilities.6\nNonetheless, during the past decade, home bias has apparently declined significantly. For most of the\nearlier postwar era, the correlation between domestic saving rates and domestic investment rates\nacross the world's major trading partners, a conventional measure of home bias, was exceptionally\nhigh.7 For OECD countries, the GDP-weighted correlation coefficient was 0.97 in 1970. However, it fell\nfrom the still elevated 0.96 in 1992 to less than 0.8 in 2002. For OECD countries excluding the United\nStates, the recent decline is even more pronounced. These declines, not surprisingly, mirror the rise in\nthe differences between saving and investment or, equivalently, of the dispersion of current account\nbalances over the same years.\nThe decline in home bias doubtless reflects, in part, vast improvements in information and\ncommunication technologies that have broadened investors' scope to the point that foreign investment\nappears less exotic and risky. Moreover, there has been an increased international tendency for\nfinancial systems to be more transparent, open, and supportive of strong investor protection.8\nAccordingly, the trend of declining home bias and expanding international financial intermediation will\nlikely continue as globalization proceeds.\n* * *\nIt is unclear at what point the rising weight of U.S. assets in global portfolios will impose restraint on\nworld current account dispersion. When that point arrives, what do we know about whether the\nprocess of reining in our current account deficit will be benign to the economies of the United States\nand the world?\nAccording to a Federal Reserve staff study, current account deficits that emerged among developed\ncountries since 1980 have risen as high as double-digit percentages of GDP before markets enforced\na reversal.9 The median high has been about 5 percent of GDP.\nComplicating the evaluation of the timing of a turnaround is that deficit countries, both developed and\nemerging, borrow in international markets largely in dollars rather than in their domestic currency. The\nUnited States has been rare in its ability to finance its external deficit in a reserve currency.10 This\n6\nWithout home bias, the dispersion of world current account balances would likely be substantially greater.\n7\nSee Martin Feldstein and Charles Horioka, \"Domestic Saving and International Capital Flows,\" The Economic Journal, June\n1980, 314-29.\n8\nResearch indicates that home bias in investment toward a foreign country is likely to be diminished to the extent that the\ncountry's financial system offers transparency, accessibility, and investor safeguards. See Alan Ahearne, William Griever,\nand Frank Warnock, \"Information Costs and Home Bias\" Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, International\nFinance Discussion Paper No. 691, December 2000.\n9\nCaroline Freund, \"Current Account Adjustment in Industrialized Countries,\" Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, International Finance Discussion Paper No. 692, December 2000.\n10\nLess than 10 percent of aggregate U.S. foreign liabilities are currently denominated in nondollar currencies. To have your\ncurrency chosen as a store of value is both a blessing and a curse. Presumably, the buildup of dollar holdings by foreigners\nhas provided Americans with lower interest rates as a consequence. But as Great Britain learned, the liquidation of sterling\nbalances after World War II exerted severe pressure on its domestic economy.\nBIS Review 3/2004\nability has presumably enlarged the capability of the United States relative to most of our trading\npartners to incur foreign debt.\n* * *\nBesides experiences with the current account deficits of other countries, there are few useful\nguideposts of how high America's net foreign liabilities can mount. The foreign accumulation of U.S.\nassets would likely slow if dollar assets, irrespective of their competitive return, came to occupy too\nlarge a share of the world's portfolio of store of value assets. In these circumstances, investors would\nseek greater diversification into nondollar assets. At the end of 2002, U.S. dollars accounted for about\n65 percent of central bank foreign exchange reserves, with the euro second at 19 percent.\nApproximately half of the much larger private cross-border holdings were denominated in dollars, with\none-third in euros.\nMore important than the way that the adjustment of the U.S. current account deficit will be initiated is\nthe effect of the adjustment on both the U.S. economy and the economies of our trading partners. The\nhistory of such adjustments has been mixed. According to the aforementioned Federal Reserve study\nof current account corrections in developed countries, although the large majority of episodes were\ncharacterized by some significant slowing of economic growth, most economies managed the\nadjustment without crisis. The institutional strengths of many of these developed economies--rule of\nlaw, transparency, and investor and property protection--likely helped to minimize disruptions\nassociated with current account adjustments. The United Kingdom, however, had significant\nadjustment difficulties in its early postwar years, as did, more recently, Mexico, Thailand, Korea,\nRussia, Brazil, and Argentina, to name just a few.\nCan market forces incrementally defuse a worrisome buildup in a nation's current account deficit and\nnet external debt before a crisis more abruptly does so? The answer seems to lie with the degree of\nflexibility in both domestic and international markets. By flexibility I mean the ability of an economy to\nabsorb shocks, stabilize, and recover. In domestic economies that approach full flexibility, imbalances\nare likely to be adjusted well before they become potentially destabilizing. In a similarly flexible world\neconomy, as debt projections rise, product and equity prices, interest rates, and exchange rates could\nchange, presumably to reestablish global balance.\nThe experience over the past two centuries of trade and finance among the individual states that make\nup the United States comes close to that paradigm of flexibility, especially given the fact that exchange\nrates among the states have been fixed and, hence, could not be part of an adjustment process.\nAlthough we have scant data on cross-border transactions among the separate states, anecdotal\nevidence suggests that over the decades significant apparent imbalances have been resolved without\nprecipitating interstate balance-of-payments crises. The dispersion of unemployment rates among the\nstates, one measure of imbalances, spikes during periods of economic stress but rapidly returns to\nmodest levels, reflecting a high degree of adjustment flexibility. That flexibility is even more apparent in\nregional money markets, where interest rates that presumably reflect differential imbalances in states'\ncurrent accounts and hence cross-border borrowing requirements have, in recent years, exhibited very\nlittle interstate dispersion. This observation suggests either negligible cross-state-border imbalances,\nan unlikely occurrence given the pattern of state unemployment dispersion, or more likely very rapid\nfinancial adjustments.\n* * *\nWe may not be able to usefully determine at what point foreign accumulation of net claims on the\nUnited States will slow or even reverse, but it is evident that the greater the degree of international\nflexibility, the less the risk of a crisis.11 The experience of the United States over the past three years is\nillustrative. The apparent ability of our economy to withstand a number of severe shocks since\nmid-2000, with only a small, temporary decline in real GDP, attests to the marked increase in our\neconomy's flexibility over the past quarter century.12\nIn evaluating the nature of the adjustment process, we need to ask whether there is something special\nin the dollar's being the world's primary reserve currency. With so few historical examples of dominant\nworld reserve currencies, we are understandably inclined to look to the experiences of the dollar's\nimmediate predecessor. At the height of sterling's role as the world's currency more than a century\nago, Great Britain had net external assets amounting to some 150 percent of its annual GDP, most of\nwhich were lost in World Wars I and II. Early post-World War II Britain was hobbled with periodic\nsterling crises, as much of the remnants of Empire endeavored to disengage themselves from heavy\nreliance on holding sterling assets as central bank reserves and private stores of value. The\nexperience of Britain's then extensively regulated economy, harboring many wartime controls well\nbeyond the end of hostilities, testifies to the costs of structural rigidity in times of crisis.\n* * *\nShould globalization be allowed to proceed and thereby create an ever more flexible international\nfinancial system, history suggests that current imbalances will be defused with little disruption. And if\nother currencies, such as the euro, emerge to share the dollar's role as a global reserve currency, that\nprocess, too, is likely to be benign.\nI say this with one major caveat. Some clouds of emerging protectionism have become increasingly\nvisible on today's horizon. Over the years, protected interests have often endeavored to stop in its\ntracks the process of unsettling economic change. Pitted against the powerful forces of market\ncompetition, virtually all such efforts have failed. The costs of any new protectionist initiatives, in the\ncontext of wide current account imbalances, could significantly erode the flexibility of the global\neconomy. Consequently, it is imperative that creeping protectionism be thwarted and reversed.\nThe question of whether globalization will be allowed to proceed rests largely on the judgment of\nwhether greater economic freedom, and the often frenetic competition it encourages, is deemed by\nleaders in societies to enhance the interests, one hopes the long-term interests, of their populations.\nSuch broad judgments in the end determine how societies are governed.\nThe reasons that some economies prosper and others sink into long-term stagnation consequently\nhas been the object of intense interest in recent decades. Agreement is growing among economic\nanalysts and policymakers that those economies that have been open to cross-border trade have, in\ngeneral, prospered. Those economies that chose to eschew such trade have done poorly. Most\neconomists have long stipulated that, for a society based on a division of labor to prosper, the\nexchange of goods and services must be subject to a rule of law--specifically, to laws protecting the\nrights of minorities and property. Presumably to be effective such arrangements must be perceived as\njust by an overwhelming majority of a society. Thus, a rule of law arguably requires democracy.\nClearly, ideas shape societies and economies. Indeed, I have maintained over the years that the most\nprofoundly important debate between conflicting theories of optimum economic organization during the\ntwentieth century was settled, presumably definitively, here more than a decade ago in the aftermath\nof the dismantling of the Berlin Wall. Aside from the Soviet Union itself, the economies of the Soviet\nbloc had been, in the prewar period, similar in many relevant respects to the market-based economies\nof the west. Over the first four decades of postwar Europe, both types of economies developed side by\nside with limited interaction. It was as close to a controlled experiment in the viability of economic\nsystems as could ever be implemented.\nThe results, evident with the dismantling of the Wall, were unequivocally in favor of market economies.\nThe consequences were far-reaching. The long-standing debate between the virtues of economies\norganized around free markets and those governed by centrally planned socialism, one must assume,\nis essentially at an end. To be sure, a few still support an old fashioned socialism. But for the vast\nmajority of previous adherents it is now a highly diluted socialism, an amalgam of social equity and\nmarket efficiency, often called market socialism. The verdict on rigid central planning has been\nrendered, and it is generally appreciated to have been unqualifiedly negative. There was no eulogy for\ncentral planning; it just ceased to be mentioned, and a large majority of developing nations quietly\nshifted from socialism to more market-oriented economies.\nEurope has accepted market capitalism in large part as the most effective means for creating material\naffluence. It does so, however, with residual misgivings.\nThe differences between the United States and continental Europe were captured most clearly for me\nin a soliloquy attributed to a prominent European leader several years ago. He asked, \"What is the\nmarket? It is the law of the jungle, the law of nature. And what is civilization? It is the struggle against\nnature.\" While acknowledging the ability of competition to promote growth, many such observers,\nnonetheless, remain concerned that economic actors, to achieve that growth, are required to behave\nin a manner governed by the law of the jungle and are hence driven to an excess of materialism.\nIn contrast to these skeptics, others, especially in the United States, believe the gains in material\nwealth resulting from market-driven outcomes facilitate the pursuit of broader values. They support a\nsystem based on voluntary choice in a free marketplace. The crux of the largely laissez-faire argument\nis that, because unencumbered competitive markets reflect the value preferences of consumers, the\nresulting price signals direct a nation's savings into those capital assets that maximize the production\nof goods and services most valued by consumers. Incomes earned from that production are\ndetermined, for the most part, by how successfully the participants in an economy contribute to the\nwelfare of consumers, the presumed purpose of a society's economy.\nClearly, not all activities undertaken in markets are civil. Many, though legal, are decidedly unsavory.\nViolation of law and breaches of trust do undermine the efficiency of markets. But the legal\nfoundations and the discipline of the marketplace are sufficiently rooted in a rule of law to limit these\naberrations. It is instructive that despite the egregious breaches of trust in recent years by a number of\nAmerica's business and financial leaders, productivity, an important metric of corporate efficiency, has\naccelerated.\n* * *\nOn net, most economists would agree that vigorous economic competition over the years has\nproduced a significant rise in the quality of life for the vast majority of the population in market-oriented\neconomies, including those at the bottom of the income distribution. The highly competitive free\nmarket paradigm, however, is viewed by many at the other end of the philosophical spectrum,\nespecially among some here in Europe, as obsessively materialistic and largely lacking in meaningful\ncultural values. Those that still harbor a visceral distaste for highly competitive market capitalism\ndoubtless gained adherents with the recent uncovering of much scandalous business behavior during\nthe boom years of the 1990s.\nBut is there a simple tradeoff between civil conduct, as defined by those who find raw competitive\nbehavior demeaning, and the quality of material life they, nonetheless, seek? It is not obvious from a\nlonger-term perspective that such a tradeoff exists in any meaningful sense.\nDuring the past century, for example, economic growth created resources far in excess of those\nrequired to maintain subsistence. That surplus, even in the most aggressively competitive economies,\nhas been in large measure employed to improve the quality of life along many dimensions. To cite a\nshort list: (1) greater longevity, owing first to the widespread development of clean, potable water and\nlater to rapid advances in medical technology; (2) a universal system of education that enabled greatly\nincreased social mobility; (3) vastly improved conditions of work; and (4) the ability to enhance our\nenvironment by setting aside natural resources rather than having to employ them to sustain a\nminimum level of subsistence. At a fundamental level, Americans, for example, have used the\nsubstantial increases in wealth generated by our market-driven economy to purchase what many\nwould view as greater civility.\n* * *\nThe collapse of the Soviet empire, and with it central planning, has left market capitalism as the\nprincipal, but not universally revered, model of economic organization. Nevertheless, the vigorous\ndebate on how economies should be organized in our increasingly globalized society and what rules\nshould govern individuals' trading appears destined to continue.",

         "Alan Greenspan: Economic flexibility\nRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, before the HM Treasury Enterprise Conference, London, England, (via satellite),\n26 January 2004.\n* * *\nAs the Great Depression of the 1930s deepened, John Maynard Keynes offered an explanation for the\nthen-bewildering series of events that was to engage economists for generations to come. Market\nsystems, he argued, contrary to the conventional wisdom, did not at all times converge to full\nemployment. They often, in economists' jargon, found equilibrium with significant segments of the\nworkforce unable to find jobs. His insight rested largely on certain perceived rigidities in labor and\nproduct markets. The notion prevalent in the 1920s and earlier - that economies, when confronted with\nunanticipated shocks, would quickly return to full employment - fell into disrepute as the depression\nfestered. In its place arose the view that government action was required to restore full employment.\nMore broadly, government intervention was increasingly seen as necessary to correct the failures and\ndeficiencies viewed as inherent in market economies. Laissez-faire was rapidly abandoned and a tidal\nwave of regulation swept over much of the world's business community. In the United States, labor\npractices, securities issuance, banking, agricultural pricing, and many other segments of the American\neconomy, fell under the oversight of government. With the onset of World War II, both the U.S. and the\nU.K. economies went on a regimented war footing. Military production ramped up rapidly and output\nreached impressive levels. Central planning, in one sense, had its finest hour. The pattern of\nproduction and distribution depended on plans devised by a small, elite group rather than responding\nto the myriad choices of consumers that rule a market economy.\nThe ostensible success of wartime economies operating at full employment, in contrast to the earlier\nfrightening developments of the depression years, thwarted a full dismantlement of wartime regimens\nwhen hostilities came to an end. Wage and price controls, coupled with rationing, lingered in many\neconomies well into the first postwar decade. Because full employment was no longer perceived as\nensured by the marketplace, government initiatives promoting job growth dominated the postwar\neconomic policy framework of the Western democracies. In the United States, the Congress passed,\nand the President signed, the \"Employment Act of 1946.\"\nHowever, cracks in the facade of government economic management emerged early in the postwar\nyears, and those cracks were to continue widening as time passed. Britain's heavily controlled\neconomy was under persistent stress as it vaulted from one crisis to another in the early postwar\ndecades. In the United States, unbalanced macroeconomic policies led to a gradual uptrend in the\nrate of inflation in the 1960s. The imposition of wage and price controls in the 1970s to deal with the\nproblem of inflation proved unworkable and ineffective. The notion that the centrally planned Soviet\neconomy was catching up with the West was, by the early 1980s, increasingly viewed as dubious,\nthough it was not fully discarded until the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 exposing the economic\nruin behind the iron curtain.\nThe East-West divisions following World War II engendered an unintended four-decades-long\nexperiment in comparative economic systems, which led, in the end, to a judgment by the vast\nmajority of policymakers that market economies were unequivocally superior to those managed by\ncentral planning. Many developing nations abandoned their Soviet-type economic systems for more\nmarket-based regimes.\nBut even earlier in the developed world, distortions induced by regulation were more and more\ndisturbing. In response, starting in the 1970s, American Presidents, supported by bipartisan majorities\nin the Congress, deregulated large segments of the transportation, communications, energy, and\nfinancial services industries. The stated purpose was to enhance competition, which was increasingly\nseen as a significant spur to productivity growth and elevated standards of living. Assisting in the\ndismantling of economic rigidities was the seemingly glacial, but persistent, lowering of barriers to\ncross-border trade and finance.\nAs a consequence, the United States, then widely seen as a once great economic power that had lost\nits way, gradually moved back to the forefront of what Joseph Schumpeter, the renowned Harvard\nprofessor, called \"creative destruction,\" the continuous scrapping of old technologies to make way for\nthe innovative. In that paradigm, standards of living rise because depreciation and other cash flows of\nindustries employing older, increasingly obsolescent, technologies are marshaled, along with new\nsavings, to finance the production of capital assets that almost always embody cutting-edge\ntechnologies. Workers, of necessity, migrate with the capital.\nThrough this process, wealth is created, incremental step by incremental step, as high levels of\nproductivity associated with innovative technologies displace lesser productive capabilities. The model\npresupposes the continuous churning of a flexible competitive economy in which the new displaces\nthe old.\nThe success of that strategy in the United States confirmed, by the 1980s, the earlier views that a\nloosening of regulatory restraint on business would improve the flexibility of our economy. Flexibility\nimplies a faster response to shocks and a correspondingly greater ability to absorb their downside\nconsequences and to recover from their aftermath. No specific program encompassed and\ncoordinated initiatives to enhance flexibility, but there was a growing recognition, both in the United\nStates and among many of our trading partners, that a market economy could best withstand and\nrecover from shocks when provided maximum flexibility.\nDevelopments that enhanced flexibility ranged far beyond regulatory or statutory change. For\nexample, employers have long been able to legally discharge employees at modest cost. But in the\nearly postwar years, profitable large corporations were dissuaded from wholesale job reduction.\nContractual inhibitions, to be sure, were then decidedly more prevalent than today, but of far greater\nimportance, our culture in the aftermath of depression frowned on such action. Only when bankruptcy\nthreatened was it perceived to be acceptable.\nBut as the depression receded into history, attitudes toward job security and tenure changed. The\nchange was first evidenced by the eventual acceptance by the American public of President Reagan's\ndischarge of federally employed air traffic controllers in 1981 when they engaged in an illegal strike.\nJob security, not a major concern of the average worker in earlier years, became a significant issue\nespecially in labor negotiations. By the early 1990s, the climate had so changed that laying off workers\nto facilitate cost reduction had become a prevalent practice. Whether this seeming greater capacity to\ndischarge workers would increase or decrease the level of structural unemployment was uncertain,\nhowever. In the event, structural unemployment decreased because the broadened freedom to\ndischarge workers rendered hiring them less of a potentially costly long-term commitment.\nThe increased flexibility of our labor market is now judged an important contributor to economic\nresilience and growth. American workers, to a large extent, see this connection and, despite the\nevident tradeoff between flexibility and job security, have not opposed innovation. An appreciation of\nthe benefits of flexibility also has been growing elsewhere. Germany recently passed labor reforms, as\nhave other continental European nations. U.K. labor markets, of course, have also experienced\nsignificant increases in flexibility in recent years.\nBeyond deregulation and culture change, innovative technologies, especially information technology,\nhave been major contributors to enhanced flexibility. A quarter-century ago, companies often required\nweeks to unearth a possible inventory imbalance, allowing production to continue to exacerbate the\nexcess. Excessive inventories, in turn, necessitated a deeper decline in output for a time than would\nhave been necessary had the knowledge of their status been fully current. The advent of innovative\ninformation technologies has significantly foreshortened the reporting lag, enabling flexible real-time\nresponses to emerging imbalances.\nDeregulation and the newer information technologies have joined, in the United States and elsewhere,\nto advance financial flexibility, which in the end may be the most important contributor to the evident\nsignificant gains in economic stability over the past two decades.\nHistorically, banks have been at the forefront of financial intermediation, in part because their ability to\nleverage offered an efficient source of funding. But too often in periods of severe financial stress, such\nleverage brought down numerous, previously vaunted banking institutions, and precipitated a financial\ncrisis that led to recession or worse. But recent regulatory reform coupled with innovative technologies\nhas spawned rapidly growing markets for, among many other products, asset-backed securities,\ncollateral loan obligations, and credit derivative default swaps.\nFinancial derivatives, more generally, have grown throughout the world at a phenomenal rate of 17\npercent per year over the past decade. Conceptual advances in pricing options and other complex\nfinancial products, along with improvements in computer and telecommunications technologies, have\nsignificantly lowered the costs of, and expanded the opportunities for, hedging risks that were not\nreadily deflected in earlier decades. The new instruments of risk dispersion have enabled the largest\nand most sophisticated banks in their credit-granting role to divest themselves of much credit risk by\npassing it to institutions with far less leverage. Insurance companies, especially those in reinsurance,\npension funds, and hedge funds continue to be willing, at a price, to supply this credit protection,\ndespite the significant losses on such products that some of these investors experienced during the\npast three years.\nThese increasingly complex financial instruments have contributed, especially over the recent stressful\nperiod, to the development of a far more flexible, efficient, and hence resilient financial system than\nexisted just a quarter-century ago. One prominent example was the response of financial markets to a\nburgeoning and then deflating telecommunications sector. Worldwide borrowing by telecommunications\nfirms in all currencies amounted to more than the equivalent of one trillion U.S. dollars during the years\n1998 to 2001. The financing of the massive expansion of fiber-optic networks and heavy investments\nin third-generation mobile-phone licenses by European firms strained debt markets.\nAt the time, the financing of these investments was widely seen as prudent because the\ntelecommunications borrowers had very high valuations in equity markets, which could facilitate a\nstock issuance, if needed, to pay down bank loans and other debt. In the event, of course, prices of\ntelecommunications stocks collapsed, and many firms went bankrupt. Write-downs were heavy,\nespecially in continental Europe, but unlike in previous periods of large financial distress, no major\nfinancial institution defaulted, and the world economy was not threatened. Thus, in stark contrast to\nmany previous episodes, the global financial system exhibited a remarkable ability to absorb and\nrecover from shocks.\n* * *\nThe most significant lesson to be learned from recent economic history is arguably the importance of\nstructural flexibility and the resilience to economic shocks that it imparts. The more flexible an\neconomy, the greater its ability to self-correct in response to inevitable, often unanticipated,\ndisturbances and thus to contain the size and consequences of cyclical imbalances. Enhanced\nflexibility has the advantage of being able to adjust automatically and not having to rest on\npolicymakers' initiatives, which often come too late or are misguided.\nI do not claim to be able to judge the relative importance of conventional stimulus and increased\neconomic flexibility to our ability to weather the shocks of the past few years. But it is difficult to\ndismiss improved flexibility as having played a key role in the U.S. economy's recent relative stability.\nIn fact, the past two recessions in the United States were the mildest in the postwar period. The\nexperience of Britain and many others during this period of time have been similar.\n* * *\nI do not doubt that the vast majority of us would prefer to work in an environment that was less\nstressful and less competitive than the one with which we currently engage. The cries of distress\namply demonstrate that flexibility and its consequence, rigorous competition, are not universally\nembraced. Flexibility in labor policies, for example, appears in some contexts to be the antithesis of\njob security. Yet, in our roles as consumers, we seem to insist on the low product prices and high\nquality that are the most prominent features of our current frenetic economic structure. If a producer\ncan offer quality at a lower price than the competition, retailers are pressed to respond because the\nconsumer will otherwise choose a shopkeeper who does. Retailers are afforded little leeway in product\nsourcing and will seek out low-cost producers, whether they are located in Guangdong province in\nChina or northern England.\nIf consumers are stern taskmasters of their marketplace, business purchasers of capital equipment\nand production materials inputs have taken the competitive paradigm a step further and applied it on a\nglobal scale.\nFrom an economic perspective, the globe has indeed shrunk. Not only have the costs of transporting\ngoods and services, relative to the total value of trade, declined over most of the postwar period, but\ninternational travel costs, relative to incomes, are down, and cross-border communications capabilities\nhave risen dramatically with the introduction of the Internet and the use of satellites. National\nboundaries are less and less a barrier to trade as companies more and more manufacture in many\ncountries and move parts and components across national boundaries with the same ease of\nmovement exhibited a half century ago within national economies. A consequence, in the eyes of\nmany, if not most, economists, world per capita real GDP over the past three decades has risen\nalmost 1-1/2 percent annually, and the proportion of the developing world's population that live on less\nthan one dollar per day has markedly declined.\nYet globalization is by no means universally admired. The frenetic pace of the competition that has\ncharacterized markets' extended global reach has engendered major churnings in labor and product\nmarkets.\nThe sensitivity of the U.S. economy and many of our trading partners to foreign competition appears to\nhave intensified recently as technological obsolescence has continued to foreshorten the expected\nprofitable life of each nation's capital stock. The more rapid turnover of our equipment and plant, as\none might expect, is mirrored in an increased turnover of jobs. A million American workers, for\nexample, currently leave their jobs every week, two-fifths involuntarily, often in association with\nfacilities that have been displaced or abandoned. A million, more or less, are also newly hired or\nreturned from layoffs every week, in part as new facilities come on stream.\nRelated to this process, jobs in the United States have been perceived as migrating abroad over the\nyears, to low-wage Japan in the 1950s and 1960s, to low-wage Mexico in the 1990s, and most\nrecently to low-wage China. Japan, of course, is no longer characterized by a low-wage workforce,\nand many in Mexico are now complaining of job losses to low-wage China.\nIn developed countries, conceptual jobs, fostered by cutting-edge technologies, are occupying an\never-increasing share of the workforce and are gradually replacing work that requires manual skills.\nThose industries in which labor costs are a significant part of overall costs have been under greater\ncompetition from foreign producers with lower labor costs, adjusted for productivity.\nThis process is not new. For generations human ingenuity has been creating industries and jobs that\nnever before existed, from vehicle assembling to computer software engineering. With those jobs\ncome new opportunities for workers with the necessary skills. In recent years, competition from abroad\nhas risen to a point at which developed countries' lowest skilled workers are being priced out of the\nglobal labor market. This diminishing of opportunities for such workers is why retraining for new job\nskills that meet the evolving opportunities created by our economies has become so urgent a priority.\nA major source of such retraining in the United States has been our community colleges, which have\nproliferated over the past two decades.\nWe can usually identify somewhat in advance which tasks are most vulnerable to being displaced by\nforeign or domestic competition. But in economies at the forefront of technology, most new jobs are\nthe consequence of innovation, which by its nature is not easily predictable. What we in the United\nStates do know is that, over the years, more than 94 percent of our workforce, on average, has been\nemployed as markets matched idled workers seeking employment to new jobs. We can thus be\nconfident that new jobs will displace old ones as they always have, but not without a high degree of\npain for those caught in the job-losing segment of America's massive job-turnover process.\n* * *\nThe onset of far greater flexibility in recent years in the labor and product markets of the United States\nand the United Kingdom, to name just two economies, raises the possibility of the resurrection of\nconfidence in the automatic rebalancing ability of markets, so prevalent in the period before Keynes. In\nits modern incarnation, the reliance on markets acknowledges limited roles for both countercyclical\nmacroeconomic policies and market-sensitive regulatory frameworks. The central burden of\nadjustment, however, is left to economic agents operating freely and in their own self-interest in\ndynamic and interrelated markets. The benefits of having moved in this direction over the past couple\nof decades are increasingly apparent. The United States has experienced quarterly declines in real\nGDP exceeding 1 percent at an annual rate on only three occasions over the past twenty years. Britain\nhas gone forty-six quarters without a downturn.\nNonetheless, so long as markets are free and human beings exhibit swings of euphoria and distress,\nthe business cycle will continue to plague us. But even granting human imperfections, flexible\neconomic institutions appear to significantly ameliorate the amplitude and duration of the business\ncycle. The benefits seem sufficiently large that special emphasis should be placed on searching for\npolicies that will foster still greater economic flexibility while seeking opportunities to dismantle policies\nthat contribute to unnecessary rigidity.\nLet me raise one final caution in this otherwise decidedly promising scenario.\nDisoriented by the quickened pace of today's competition, some in the United States look back with\nnostalgia to the seemingly more tranquil years of the early post-World War II period, when tariff walls\nwere perceived as providing job security from imports. Were we to yield to such selective nostalgia\nand shut out a large part, or all, of imports of manufactured goods and produce those goods\nourselves, our overall standards of living would fall. In today's flexible markets, our large, but finite,\ncapital and labor resources are generally employed most effectively. Any diversion of resources from\nthe market-guided activities would, of necessity, engender a less-productive mix.\nFor the most part, we in the United States have not engaged in significant and widespread\nprotectionism for more than five decades. The consequences of moving in that direction in today's far\nmore globalized financial world could be unexpectedly destabilizing.\nI remain optimistic that we and our global trading partners will shun that path. The evidence is simply\ntoo compelling that our mutual interests are best served by promoting the free flow of goods and\nservices among our increasingly flexible and dynamic market economies.",

         "Susan Schmidt Bies: Enterprise-wide compliance programs\nSpeech by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Bond Market Association's Legal and Compliance Conference, New York,\n4 February 2004.\n* * *\nIntroduction\nI want to thank the Bond Market Association for the opportunity to speak to you this afternoon. Given\nthe evolution of the financial markets and financial services industry and the unfortunate events that\nsome firms have recently encountered, comprehensive and robust management of legal and\nreputational risks is becoming more essential. The agenda for this conference reflects many of the\nconcerns that have been raised over the past two years regarding legal and reputational risks in\ngeneral, and conflicts of interest, the adequacy of public disclosures, and the transparency of\naccounting in particular.\nI know that we all hoped that with the new year we could put behind us the corporate governance\nshortcomings and financial restatements of the past several quarters. Unfortunately, the news about\nParmalat demonstrates that we are not yet out of the woods and that corporate governance problems\nare not limited to the United States, but are a global issue. Financial firms are facing losses and\npossible legal and reputational risks in connection with their dealings with this company. The industry\nstill has a lot of work to do in managing risks, and this conference is an excellent step toward\naddressing important risk-management issues in the context of the compliance function.\nIn addition to sponsoring this timely conference, the Bond Market Association has been at the forefront\nof myriad initiatives relating to risk management and compliance. One especially important initiative\nhas been the association's participation with other industry groups in establishing the Joint Market\nPractices Forum. The forum's first initiative has been to articulate a statement of principles regarding\nthe handling and use of material, nonpublic information by credit market participants. The statement of\nprinciples fulfills a number of objectives. The most critical, in my view, is the promotion of fair and\ncompetitive markets in which inappropriate use of material, nonpublic information is not tolerated. At\nthe same time, the statement allows lenders to effectively manage credit-portfolio activities to facilitate\nborrower access to more-liquid and more-efficient sources of credit. This recognizes that the liquidity\nand efficiency of our financial markets are related directly to the integrity of, and public confidence in,\nthose markets.\nThe forum's statement of principles also provides a number of meaningful recommendations, some of\nwhich have already been adopted by the major participants in the credit derivatives market. The\nstatement and recommendations have sparked much-needed discussion and helped identify issues,\nsuch as conflicts of interest and insider trading, that may arise in connection with credit portfolio\nmanagement. These are important steps toward improving the risk-management environment, and I\ncommend you for voluntarily taking the initiative.\nOne aspect of the forum's statement that I would particularly like to applaud is its focus on controls\nand compliance across the consolidated organization, because that focus ties directly to my remarks\ntoday. Specifically, I would like to discuss the need for financial services firms to develop\nenterprisewide compliance programs for legal and reputational risk management. As financial firms continue to\ngrow more complex and add new products, services, and activities - all of which are natural and\npositive market developments - they need to have a process to facilitate the evolution of the culture of\ncompliance across the organization.\nI am first going to discuss the importance of an enterprise-wide approach to risk management and\nidentify some particular areas in which an integrated approach can improve internal controls. Then I\nwill talk about how compliance and internal audit can foster effective risk management.\nEnterprise-wide risk-management framework\nWhat do I mean by an enterprise-wide compliance program? I would define it as an integral part of an\noverall risk-management framework that is adopted by an entity's board of directors and senior\nmanagement and is applied in setting a strategy throughout a firm. As you may know, the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, is in the process of finalizing an\nenterprise-wide risk-management framework that is expected to be published later this year. The\nprinciples the new COSO document espouses transcend functional areas, and I expect that it will be\nan important contribution to the ongoing discussion of how risk management can be strengthened\nacross different types of organizations and functional areas.\nFor those of you not familiar with the COSO framework, let me briefly explain that an enterprise-wide\nrisk-management framework identifies potential events that may affect the entity and establishes how\nthe organization will manage its risk given the firm's risk appetite and strategic direction. In an\nenterprise-wide risk-management framework, managers are expected to evaluate at least annually the\nrisks and controls within their scope of authority and to report the results of this process to the chief\nrisk officer and the audit committee of the board of directors.\nIn evaluating risks, managers need to consider both current and planned or anticipated operational\nand market changes and identify the risks arising from those changes. Once risks have been identified\ncomprehensively, assessed, and evaluated as to their potential impact on the organization,\nmanagement must determine the effectiveness of existing controls and develop and implement\nadditional appropriate mitigating controls where needed.\nThe robustness and effectiveness of these controls must be evaluated independently, soon after the\ncontrol structure is established, so that any shortcomings can be identified promptly and corrected.\nRisk assessments initiated early in the planning process can give the firm time to implement mitigating\nbefore\ncontrols and conduct a validation of the quality of those controls launching the product. Strong\ninternal controls and governance require that these assessments be done by an independent group.\nOne of the weaknesses that we have seen is that management delegates both the development and\nthe assessment of the internal control structure to the same risk-management, internal audit,\ncompliance, or legal division. Instead, it is important to emphasize that line management has the\nresponsibility for identifying risks and ensuring that the mitigating controls are effective, and that the\nassessments should be done by a group independent of that line organization.\nAn enterprise-wide approach also can integrate the risk assessment of functions that have traditionally\nbeen managed in \"silos\". Conflicts can arise in many different areas and functions of the firm, including\nsales and research. Conflicts can also occur when compensation structures create incentives\ninconsistent with prudent risk management or when the bottom line for the current quarter is unduly\nemphasized without adequate consideration of the risk being taken to accomplish those results. The\npotential for these conflicts to arise must be addressed squarely by senior management, and\nappropriate controls must be in place to manage and mitigate conflicts.\nA culture of compliance should establish - from the top of the organization - the proper ethical tone that\nwill govern the conduct of business. In many instances, senior management must move from thinking\nabout compliance chiefly as a cost center to considering the benefits of compliance in protecting\nagainst legal and reputational risks that can have an impact on the bottom line. It is important to note\nthat the board of directors and senior management of financial firms are responsible for setting the\n\"tone at the top\" and developing the compliance culture that has been discussed at this conference.\nThe board and senior management are obligated to deliver a strong message to others in the firm\nabout the importance of integrity, compliance with the law, and overall good business ethics. They also\nneed to demonstrate their commitment through their individual conduct and their response to control\nfailures. The message and corresponding conduct should empower line staff to elevate ethical or\nreputational concerns to appropriate levels of management without fear of retribution.\nReputational and legal risks pose major threats to financial services firms because the nature of their\nbusiness requires maintaining the confidence of customers, creditors, and the general marketplace.\nImportantly, legal and reputational risk can negatively affect the profitability, and ultimately the viability,\nof a financial firm.\nEnterprise-wide compliance program\nA strong compliance program is an integral part of the risk-management function. For the reasons I will\ndiscuss, the best practice in complex financial firms is to conduct risk management on an\nenterprisewide basis. As a result, compliance activities should be managed on an enterprise-wide basis as well.\nTraditional risk management has focused on quantifiable risks, such as credit and market risks.\nRecent events have demonstrated the need for greater focus on the risks that are harder to quantify -\nthat is, operational, legal, and reputational risks. Indeed, legal and reputational risks are significant\nrisks facing some financial firms today. The compliance area is critically important in identifying,\nevaluating, and addressing legal and reputational risks. Given the significance of these risks, a strong\nenterprise-wide compliance program is a necessity for complex financial firms. A well-executed\ncompliance program can also highlight operational problems.\nAs an integral part of an enterprise-wide risk management, an enterprise-wide compliance program\nlooks at and across business lines and activities of the organization as a whole to consider how\nactivities in one area of the firm may affect the legal and reputational risks of other business lines and\nthe enterprise as a whole. It considers how compliance with laws, regulations, and internal policies,\nprocedures, and controls should be enhanced or changed in response. This approach is in marked\ncontrast to the silo approach to compliance, which considers the legal and reputational risks of\nactivities or business lines in isolation without considering how those risks interrelate and affect other\nbusiness lines. The silo approach to compliance has prevailed for far too long in financial firms. We\nare overdue for a paradigm shift to an enterprise-wide compliance structure as we also shift to\nenterprise-wide risk management.\nThe Wall\nWhy is an enterprise-wide compliance program so important? Recently, in an interview with\nStreet Journal, the independent board chairman of a prominent mutual fund company involved in the\nmarket-timing scandal identified as one of the firm's compliance breakdowns the bifurcation of\ncompliance responsibilities within the firm. That is, no one had the 25,000-foot view of what was\nhappening across the organization, and this led to internal control shortcomings that were not\nidentified and to opportunities for employees to take unfair advantage of other market participants.\nMoreover, the compliance function did not have the status and perceived importance it should have\nhad. The company's board reportedly has installed a board-level compliance officer in response to a\nreview of the circumstances surrounding the control deficiencies. This addition helps to ensure that the\nboard, the group that is ultimately responsible for risk management, can assess the quality and\nrobustness of compliance across the organization.\nEnterprise-wide compliance programs incorporate controls that include transaction approval and\nmonitoring procedures in all relevant functional areas. They also provide all decisionmakers with\ncomplete and comprehensive information about the proposed transaction. Involving all relevant\nfunctional areas and decisionmakers allows for an enhanced review of a transaction, one that\nconsiders the impact of the transaction across the consolidated organization. As a result, compliance\nis conducted on a comprehensive, holistic basis and not in silos. Involving all functional areas and\ndecisionmakers also focuses attention on all the relationships a client may have across the\norganization, allowing identification of conflicts of interest or other sources of legal and reputational\nrisks.\nViewing compliance across the organization's different functions minimizes the potential for legal and\nreputational risks to be overlooked. As a result, compliance policies, procedures, and controls are less\nlikely to be inadequate. For example, conflict-of-interest policies and controls may be inadequate if risk\nmanagement in the traditional credit function does not also consider the activities being conducted in\nthe trading and sales areas.\nAn enterprise-wide compliance program helps management and the board understand where the legal\nand reputational risks in the organization are concentrated, provides comparisons of the level and\nchanging nature of risks, and identifies those control processes that most need enhancement. This\nprocess, in turn, can facilitate analysis of whether the legal and reputational risks taken in a particular\npart of the organization are appropriate. Of course, the ability to assess legal and reputational risks\nacross the enterprise depends heavily on the quality and timeliness of information. The compliance\nfunction must ensure that controls and procedures capture the appropriate information to allow senior\nmanagement and the board to better perform their risk management functions.\nThe enterprise-wide compliance function should look at what is being reported to the board, the audit\ncommittee, and senior management regarding new or changed processes, procedures, and controls.\nIs there an effective mechanism for reporting control failures or limit exceptions? How are these\nexceptions pursued for follow-up action, and how are corrective actions communicated back to the\nboard or management? Importantly, the compliance function should have a direct line to the general\ncounsel through which it can report concerns and needed improvements to processes and controls.\nThe focus on an enterprise-wide approach to compliance does not mean that the organization cannot\nleverage off of specific business-line compliance functions. Indeed, it is very important to retain\nbusiness-line compliance functions because they are staffed by individuals who understand the\nactivities being conducted and know where control breakdowns have occurred in the past. For\nexample, the compliance function for a trading operation requires staff with detailed understanding of\nthe back office, the middle office, and the front office. The enterprise-wide compliance approach\nsupplements this business-line-specific view of compliance with a big-picture approach at the\ncorporate level that encompasses and has access to all lines of business and operational areas. It\nincorporates the various business-line compliance reviews in assessing the robustness and adequacy\nof enterprise-wide legal and reputational risk management, and it ensures that significant issues are\nbrought to the attention of senior global compliance officers as appropriate.\nThe enterprise-wide view is particularly important when functions cross business lines and\nmanagement lines of responsibility. When business lines or managers share responsibility for\ncompliance, specific duties and chains of accountability need to be established at the\nlinemanagement level and overseen by the person ultimately responsible for compliance across the\norganization.\nAn enterprise-wide compliance program is also dynamic, constantly assessing new legal and\nreputational risks when new business lines or activities are added or existing activities are altered.\nConstant reassessment of risks and controls and communication with the business lines is necessary\nto avoid a compliance program that is operating on autopilot and does not proactively respond to\nchange in the organization.\nThe role of the new-product approval process\nThe compliance program is an important participant in the new-product approval process, along with\nother relevant parties, including credit risk, market risk, operations, accounting, legal, audit, and senior\nline management. Compliance personnel should have an active voice in determining whether a\nparticular activity or product constitutes a new product requiring review and approval. New products\ninclude products or services being offered to, or activities being conducted for the first time in, a new\nmarket or to a new category of customers or counterparties. For example, a product traditionally\nmarketed to institutional customers that is being rolled out to retail customers (hedge funds, for\ninstance) generally should be reviewed as a new product. In addition, significant modifications to\nproducts, services, and activities or their pricing warrant review as a new product. Even small changes\nin the terms of products or the scope of services or activities can greatly alter their risk profiles and\njustify review as a new product. When in doubt about whether a product, service, or activity warrants\nreview as a new product, financial firms should err on the side of conservatism and route the proposal\nthrough the new-product approval process. Cutting short a new-product review because of a rush to\ndeliver a new product to market, or because of performance pressures, increases the potential for\nserious legal and reputational risk.\nThe determination of whether a new or modified activity requires additional compliance processes,\nprocedures, or controls is clearly the province of the compliance staff. It involves the interaction of\nbusiness-line compliance staff with personnel responsible for enterprise-wide risk management. Once\nthese processes, procedures, or controls are designed, compliance personnel should help ensure that\nthose controls are implemented effectively and are a comprehensive response to the legal and\nreputational risks posed.\nThe role of internal audit\nJust as the compliance area performs an independent review of the firm's activities and business lines,\nthe compliance program also needs to be reviewed independently. Internal audit has the responsibility\nto review the enterprise-wide compliance program to determine if it is accomplishing the firm's stated\nobjectives, and if it is adequately and appropriately staffed, in light of growth, changes in the firm's\nbusiness mix, new customers, strategic initiatives, reorganizations, and process changes. Internal\naudit should evaluate the firm's adherence to its own compliance and control processes and assess\nthe adequacy of those processes in light of the complexity and legal and reputational risk profile of the\norganization.\nIt should be obvious that internal audit, like the compliance program, needs to be staffed with\npersonnel who have the necessary skills and experience to report on compliance with financial\ninstitution policies and procedures. Internal audit should test transactions to validate that business\nlines are complying with the firm's standards and report the results of that testing to the board or audit\ncommittee, as appropriate.\nStructured transactions\nThere are \"lessons learned\" from the legal and reputational risks that some financial firms faced in\nstructuring transactions for Enron and WorldCom, among others. Those legal and reputational risks\nrequire a focus on appropriateness assessments, the enforceability of netting and collateral\nagreements, undocumented customer assurances, insurance considerations, and potential IRS\nchallenges.\nAssessments of the appropriateness of a transaction for a client traditionally have required firms to\ndetermine if the transaction is consistent with the financial sophistication, financial condition, and\ninvestment policies of the customer. Given recent events, it is appropriate to raise the bar on\nappropriateness assessments in the approval process for complex structured transactions by taking\ninto account the business purpose and economic substance of the transaction.\nWhen firms provide advice on, arrange, or actively participate in a complex structured finance\ntransaction, they may assume legal and reputational risks if the end-user enters into the transaction for\nimproper purposes. Firms should have effective and consistent policies and procedures that require a\nthorough review of the business purposes and economic substance of the transaction by all relevant\nfunctional areas and an assessment of any legal or reputational risks posed by the transaction. In\ninstances that present heightened legal or reputational risk, the policies and procedures should require\na review, by appropriate senior management, of the customer's business relationship with the firm. Of\ncourse, these policies and procedures need to be supported and enforced by a strong tone at the top\nand a firm-wide culture of compliance.\nConclusion\nThe evolution of the financial markets and the number of significant governance issues recently faced\nby complex financial firms clearly underscore the need to view risk management on an enterprise-wide\nbasis. An integral part of a robust legal and reputational risk-management function is a strong\ncompliance program. For such programs to be effective in complex financial institutions, compliance\nmust be addressed on an enterprise-wide basis.",

         "Alan Greenspan: Federal Reserve Board's semiannual monetary policy report\nto the Congress\nTestimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington,\n11 February 2004.\n* * *\nMr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to be here today to present the Federal\nReserve's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\nWhen I testified before this committee in July, I reported that conditions had become a good deal more\nsupportive of economic expansion over the previous few months. A notable reduction in geopolitical\nconcerns, strengthening confidence in economic prospects, and an improvement in financial\nconditions boded well for spending and production over the second half of the year. Still, convincing\nsigns of a sustained acceleration in activity were not yet in evidence. Since then, the picture has\nbrightened. The gross domestic product expanded vigorously over the second half of 2003 while\nproductivity surged, prices remained stable, and financial conditions improved further. Overall, the\neconomy has made impressive gains in output and real incomes; however, progress in creating jobs\nhas been limited.\nLooking forward, the prospects are good for sustained expansion of the U.S. economy. The household\nsector's financial condition is stronger, and the business sector has made substantial strides in\nbolstering balance sheets. Narrowing credit risk spreads and a considerable rally in equity prices have\nreduced financing costs and increased household wealth, which should provide substantial support for\nspending by businesses and households. With short-term real interest rates close to zero, monetary\npolicy remains highly accommodative. And it appears that the impetus from fiscal policy will stay\nexpansionary, on net, through this year. These circumstances all should spur the expansion of\naggregate demand in 2004. At the same time, increases in efficiency and a significant level of\nunderutilized resources should help keep a lid on inflation.\nIn retrospect, last year appears to have marked a transition from an extended period of subpar\neconomic performance to one of more vigorous expansion. Once again, household spending was the\nmainstay, with real personal consumption spending increasing nearly 4 percent and real outlays on\nresidential structures rising about 10 percent. Last year's reductions in personal income tax rates and\nthe advance of rebates to those households that were eligible for the expanded child tax credit\nboosted the growth of real disposable personal income. The very low level of interest rates also\nencouraged household spending through a variety of channels. Automakers took advantage of low\ninterest rates to offer attractive incentive deals, buoying the purchase of new vehicles. The lowest\nhome mortgage rates in decades were a major contributor to record sales of existing residences,\nengendering a large extraction of cash from home equity. A significant part of that cash supported\npersonal consumption expenditures and home improvement. In addition, many households took out\ncash in the process of refinancing, often using the proceeds to substitute for higher-cost consumer\ndebt. That refinancing also permitted some households to lower the monthly carrying costs for their\nhomes and thus freed up funds for other expenditures. Not least, the low mortgage rates spurred sales\nand starts of new homes to very high levels.\nThese developments were reflected in household financing patterns. Home mortgage debt increased\nabout 13 percent last year, while consumer credit expanded much more slowly. Even though the ratio\nof overall household debt to income continued to increase, as it has for more than a half-century, the\nrise in home and equity prices enabled the ratio of household net worth to disposable income to\nrecover to a little above its long-term average. The low level of interest rates and large volume of\nmortgage refinancing activity helped reduce households' debt-service and financial-obligation ratios a\nbit. And many measures of consumer credit quality improved over the year, with delinquency rates on\nconsumer loans and home mortgages declining.\nA strengthening in capital spending over 2003 contributed importantly to the acceleration of real\noutput. In the first quarter of the year, business fixed investment extended the downtrend that began in\nearly 2001. Capital spending, however, ramped up considerably over the final three quarters of 2003,\nreflecting a pickup in expenditures for equipment and software. Outlays for high-tech equipment\nshowed particular vigor last year. Even spending on communications equipment, which had been quite\nsoft in the previous two years, accelerated. A growing confidence of business executives in the\ndurability of the expansion, strong final sales, the desire to renew capital stocks after replacements\nhad been postponed, and favorable financial conditions all contributed to the turnaround in equipment\nspending.\nBy contrast, expenditures on nonresidential structures continued to contract on balance, albeit less\nrapidly than in 2001 and 2002. High vacancy rates for office buildings and low rates of capacity\nutilization in manufacturing evidently limited the demand for new structures. Inventory investment\nlikewise failed to pick up much momentum over the year, as managers remained cautious. Firms\nfinished 2003 with lean inventories relative to sales, an encouraging sign for the expansion of\nproduction going forward.\nTo a considerable degree, the gathering strength of capital spending reflects a substantial\nimprovement in the financial condition of businesses over the past few years. Firms' profits rose\nsteeply during 2003 following smaller gains in the previous two years. The significantly stronger cash\nflow generated by profits and depreciation allowances was more than adequate to cover rising capital\nexpenditures in the aggregate. As a result, businesses had little need to borrow during 2003. For the\nnonfinancial business sector as a whole, debt is estimated to have grown just 3-1/2 percent.\nFirms encountered very receptive conditions in longer-term credit markets in 2003. Interest rate\nspreads on both investment-grade and speculative-grade bond issues narrowed substantially over the\nyear, as investors apparently became more confident about the economic expansion and saw less risk\nof adverse shocks from accounting and other corporate scandals. Corporate treasurers took\nadvantage of the attractive market conditions by issuing long-term debt to lengthen the maturities of\ncorporate liabilities.\nAs a consequence, net short-term financing was extremely weak. The stock of business loans\nextended by banks and commercial paper issued by nonfinancial firms declined more than $100 billion\nover the year, apparently owing to slack demand for short-term credit rather than to a constriction in\nsupply. Interest-rate spreads on commercial paper, like those on corporate bonds, were quite narrow.\nAnd although a Federal Reserve survey indicates that banks had continued to tighten lending\nconditions early in the year, by the second half, terms and standards were being eased noticeably.\nMoreover, responses to that survey pointed to a lack of demand for business loans until late in the\nyear.\nPartly as a result of the balance-sheet restructuring, business credit quality appears to have\nrecuperated considerably over the past few years. Last year, the default rate on bonds fell sharply,\nrecovery rates on defaulted issues rose, the number of rating downgrades moderated substantially,\nand delinquencies on business loans continued to decline. The improved balance sheets and strong\nprofits of business firms, together with attractive terms for financing in open markets and from banks,\nsuggest that financial conditions remain quite supportive of further gains in capital spending in coming\nquarters.\nThe profitability of the business sector was again propelled by stunning increases in productivity. The\nadvance in output per hour in the nonfarm business sector picked up to 5-1/4 percent in 2003 after\nunusually brisk gains in the previous two years. The productivity performance of the past few years\nhas been particularly striking in that these increases occurred in a period of relatively sluggish output\ngrowth. The vigorous advance in efficiency represents a notable extension of the pickup that started\naround the mid-1990s. Apparently, businesses are still reaping the benefits of the marked acceleration\nin technology.\nThe strong gains in productivity, however, have obviated robust increases in business payrolls. To\ndate, the expansion of employment has significantly lagged increases in output. Gross separations\nfrom employment, two-fifths of which have been involuntary, are about what would be expected from\npast cyclical experience, given the current pace of output growth. New hires and recalls from layoffs,\nhowever, are far below what historical experience indicates. To a surprising degree, firms seem able\nto continue identifying and implementing new efficiencies in their production processes and thus have\nfound it possible so far to meet increasing orders without stepping up hiring.\nIn all likelihood, employment will begin to grow more quickly before long as output continues to\nexpand. Productivity over the past few years has probably received a boost from the efforts of\nbusinesses to work off the stock of inefficiencies that had accumulated in the boom years. As those\nopportunities to enhance efficiency become scarcer and as managers become more confident in the\ndurability of the expansion, firms will surely once again add to their payrolls.\nA consequence of the rapid gains in productivity and slack in our labor and product markets has been\nsustained downward pressure on inflation. As measured by the chain-weighted price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, prices rose less than 1 percent in\n2003. Given the biases in such indexes, this performance puts measured inflation in a range\nconsistent with price stability--a statutory objective of the Federal Reserve and a key goal of all central\nbanks because it is perceived as a prerequisite for maximum sustainable economic growth.\nThe recent performance of inflation has been especially notable in view of the substantial depreciation\nof the dollar in 2003. Against a broad basket of currencies of our trading partners, the foreign\nexchange value of the U.S. dollar has declined about 13 percent from its peak in early 2002.\nOrdinarily, currency depreciation is accompanied by a rise in dollar prices of imported goods and\nservices, because foreign exporters endeavor to avoid experiencing price declines in their own\ncurrencies, which would otherwise result from the fall in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.\nReflecting the swing from dollar appreciation to dollar depreciation, the dollar prices of goods and\nservices imported into the United States have begun to rise after declining on balance for several\nyears, but the turnaround to date has been mild. Apparently, foreign exporters have been willing to\nabsorb some of the price decline measured in their own currencies and the consequent squeeze on\nprofit margins it entails.\nPart of exporters' losses, however, have apparently been offset by short forward positions against the\ndollar in foreign exchange markets. A marked increase in foreign exchange derivative trading,\nespecially in dollar-euro, is consistent with significant hedging of exports to the United States and to\nother markets that use currencies tied to the U.S. dollar. However, most contracts are short-term\nbecause long-term hedging is expensive. Thus, although hedging may delay the adjustment, it cannot\neliminate the consequences of exchange rate change. Accordingly, the currency depreciation that we\nhave experienced of late should eventually help to contain our current account deficit as foreign\nproducers export less to the United States. On the other side of the ledger, the current account should\nimprove as U.S. firms find the export market more receptive.\n* * *\nAlthough the prospects for the U.S. economy look quite favorable, we need to remind ourselves that\nall forecasts are projections into an uncertain future. The fact that most professional forecasters\nperceive much the same benign short-term outlook that is our most likely expectation provides scant\ncomfort. When the future surprises, history tells us, it often surprises us all. We must, as a\nconsequence, remain alert to risks that could threaten the sustainability of the expansion.\nBesides the chronic concern about a sharp spike in oil or natural gas prices, a number of risks can be\nidentified. Of particular importance to monetary policy makers is the possibility that our stance could\nbecome improperly calibrated to evolving economic developments. To be sure, the Federal Open\nMarket Committee's current judgment is that its accommodative posture is appropriate to foster\nsustainable expansion of economic activity. But the evidence indicates clearly that such a policy\nstance will not be compatible indefinitely with price stability and sustainable growth; the real federal\nfunds rate will eventually need to rise toward a more neutral level. However, with inflation very low and\nsubstantial slack in the economy, the Federal Reserve can be patient in removing its current policy\naccommodation.\nIn the process of assessing risk, we monitor a broad range of economic and financial indicators.\nIncluded in this group are a number of measures of liquidity and credit creation in the economy. By\nmost standard measures, aggregate liquidity does not appear excessive. The monetary aggregate M2\nexpanded only 5-1/4 percent during 2003, somewhat less than nominal GDP, and actually contracted\nduring the fourth quarter. The growth of nonfederal debt, at 7-3/4 percent, was relatively brisk in 2003.\nHowever, a significant portion of that growth was associated with the record turnover of existing\nhomes and the high level of cash-out refinancing, which are not expected to continue at their recent\npace. A narrower measure, that of credit held by banks, also grew only moderately in 2003. All told,\nour accommodative monetary policy stance to date does not seem to have generated excessive\nvolumes of liquidity or credit.\nThat said, as we evaluate the risks to the economy, we also assess developments in financial\nmarkets. Broad measures of equity prices rose 25 percent in 2003, and technology stocks increased\ntwice as quickly. The rally has extended into this year. And as I noted previously, credit spreads on\ncorporate bonds have narrowed considerably, particularly for speculative-grade issues. This\nperformance of financial markets importantly reflects investors' response to robust earnings growth\nand the repair of business balance sheets over the past few years. However, history shows that\npricing financial assets appropriately in real time can be extremely difficult and that, even in a\nseemingly benign economic environment, risks remain.\nThe outlook for the federal budget deficit is another critical issue for policymakers in assessing our\nintermediate- and long-run growth prospects and the risks to those prospects. As you are well aware,\nafter a brief period of unified budget surpluses around the beginning of this decade, the federal budget\nhas reverted to deficits. The unified deficit swelled to $375 billion in fiscal 2003 and appears to be\nwidening considerably further in the current fiscal year. In part, these deficits are a result of the\neconomic downturn and the period of slower growth that we recently experienced, as well as the\nearlier decline in equity prices. The deficits also reflect fiscal actions specifically intended to provide\nstimulus to the economy, a significant step-up in spending for national security, and a tendency toward\ndiminished restraint on discretionary spending. Of course, as economic activity continues to expand,\ntax revenues should strengthen and the deficit will tend to narrow, all else being equal. But even\nbudget projections that attempt to take such business-cycle influences into account, such as those\nfrom the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget, indicate that very\nsizable deficits are in prospect in the years to come.\nAs I have noted before, the debate over budget priorities appears to be between those advocating\nadditional tax cuts and those advocating increased spending. Although some stirrings in recent weeks\nin the Congress and elsewhere have been directed at actions that would lower forthcoming deficits, to\ndate no effective constituency has offered programs to balance the budget. One critical element\n- present in the 1990s but now absent - is a framework of procedural rules to help fiscal policy makers\nmake the difficult decisions that are required to forge a better fiscal balance.\nThe imbalance in the federal budgetary situation, unless addressed soon, will pose serious\nlongerterm fiscal difficulties. Our demographics - especially the retirement of the baby-boom generation\nbeginning in just a few years - mean that the ratio of workers to retirees will fall substantially. Without\ncorrective action, this development will put substantial pressure on our ability in coming years to\nprovide even minimal government services while maintaining entitlement benefits at their current level,\nwithout debilitating increases in tax rates. The longer we wait before addressing these imbalances, the\nmore wrenching the fiscal adjustment ultimately will be.\nThe fiscal issues that we face pose long-term challenges, but federal budget deficits could cause\ndifficulties even in the relatively near term. Long-term interest rates reflect not only the balance\nbetween the current demand for, and current supply of, credit, they also incorporate markets'\nexpectations of those balances in the future. As a consequence, should investors become significantly\nmore doubtful that the Congress will take the necessary fiscal measures, an appreciable backup in\nlong-term interest rates is possible as prospects for outsized federal demands on national saving\nbecome more apparent. Such a development could constrain investment and other interest-sensitive\nspending and thus undermine the private capital formation that is a key element in our economy's\ngrowth prospects.\nAddressing the federal budget deficit is even more important in view of the widening U.S. current\naccount deficit. In 2003, the current account deficit reached $550 billion - about 5 percent of nominal\nGDP. The current account deficit and the federal budget deficit are related because the large federal\ndissaving represented by the budget deficit, together with relatively low rates of U.S. private saving,\nimplies a need to attract saving from abroad to finance domestic private investment spending.\nTo date, the U.S. current account deficit has been financed with little difficulty. Although the foreign\nexchange value of the dollar has fallen over the past year, the decline generally has been gradual, and\nno material adverse side effects have been visible in U.S. capital markets. While demands for\ndollardenominated assets by foreign private investors are off their record pace of mid-2003, such investors\nevidently continue to perceive the United States as an excellent place to invest, no doubt owing, in\nlarge part, to our vibrant market system and our economy's very strong productivity performance.\nMoreover, some governments have accumulated large amounts of dollar-denominated debt as a\nbyproduct of resisting upward exchange rate adjustment.\nNonetheless, given the already-substantial accumulation of dollar-denominated debt, foreign investors,\nboth private and official, may become less willing to absorb ever-growing claims on U.S. residents.\nTaking steps to increase our national saving through fiscal action to lower federal budget deficits\nwould help diminish the risks that a further reduction in the rate of purchase of dollar assets by foreign\ninvestors could severely crimp the business investment that is crucial for our long-term growth.\nThe large current account deficits and the associated substantial trade deficits pose another\nimperative - the need to maintain the degree of flexibility that has been so prominent a force for U.S.\neconomic stability in recent years. The greatest current threat to that flexibility is protectionism, a\ndanger that has become increasingly visible on today's landscape. Over the years, protected interests\nhave often endeavored to stop in its tracks the process of unsettling economic change. Pitted against\nthe powerful forces of market competition, virtually all such efforts have failed. The costs of any new\nprotectionist initiatives, in the context of wide current account imbalances, could significantly erode the\nflexibility of the global economy. Consequently, creeping protectionism must be thwarted and\nreversed.\n* * *\nIn summary, in recent years the U.S. economy has demonstrated considerable resilience to adversity.\nIt has overcome significant shocks that, in the past, could have hobbled growth for a much longer\nperiod than they have in the current cycle. As I have noted previously, the U.S. economy has become\nfar more flexible over the past two decades, and associated improvements have played a key role in\nlessening the effects of the recent adverse developments on our economy. Looking forward, the odds\nof sustained robust growth are good, although, as always, risks remain. The Congress can help foster\nsustainable expansion by taking steps to reduce federal budget deficits and thus contribute to national\nsaving and by continuing to pursue opportunities to open markets and promote trade. For our part, the\nFederal Reserve intends to use its monetary tools to promote our goals of economic growth and\nmaximum employment of our resources in an environment of effective price stability.",

         "Susan Schmidt Bies: Financial markets and corporate governance\nRemarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Economic Club of Memphis dinner, Memphis, 19 February 2004.\n* * *\nI am so pleased to be back in Memphis tonight and to speak to the Economic Club of Memphis, an\norganization that I once had the honor to chair. Some of you have asked about my experience as a\nmember of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and I find that I am dealing with\nfamiliar issues that I have frequently addressed in my business career, but from a different\nperspective. Tonight, I want to touch on one of those areas, corporate governance, but I also want to\nfocus on the way a central banker considers corporate governance issues, particularly how these\nissues affect the performance of financial markets and the functioning of the economic system.\nThe governance problems that have come to light over the past couple of years have focused\nattention on the quality of accounting standards, the professionalism of auditors, and the governance\npractices of major companies and, most recently, of mutual funds. These scandals have been the\ntopic of much debate and have triggered a spate of regulatory reforms.\nHowever, rather than review the litany of scandals and regulatory responses, I would like to step back\nand discuss some broader, longer-term issues that affect accounting and corporate governance.\nLooking beyond the isolated cases of outright fraud, I believe a fundamental problem is this: as\norganizations have grown in size and scope, innovative financing techniques have made it more\ndifficult for outside investors to understand a particular firm's risk profile and the performance of its\nvarious lines of business. Traditional accounting standards have not kept pace with the\nriskmanagement tools employed by sophisticated corporations. Thus, more meaningful disclosure of\nfirms' risk-management positions and strategies is crucial for improving corporate transparency for\nmarket participants.\nThe second issue I want to explore is how corporate governance in the United States is shaped by the\nincreasing importance of institutional investors, such as mutual funds and pension funds, as major\nholders of corporate equity. Two themes will emerge. The first is that institutional investors may play a\nrole as delegated monitors in helping to promote efficient governance. The second is that delegated\nmonitors are subject to their own governance challenges. Unfortunately, this last point is illustrated all\ntoo well by the governance problems that have recently surfaced in the U.S. mutual fund industry.\nFinancial innovations and disclosure\nOver the past few decades, firms have acquired effective new tools with which to manage financial\nrisk. For example, securitization helps a firm manage the risk of a concentrated exposure by\ntransferring some of that exposure outside the firm. By pooling assets and issuing marketable\nsecurities, firms obtain liquidity and reduce funding costs. Of course, moving assets off the balance\nsheet and into special purpose entities, with the attendant creation of servicing rights and high risk\nresidual interests retained by firms, generates its own risks and reduces transparency unless the firm\ntakes additional steps to enhance disclosure.\nSeveral types of securitization have grown rapidly over the past decade. One of the fastest growing\nhas been asset-backed commercial paper, which soared from only $16 billion outstanding at the end\nof 1989 to about $690 billion as of year-end 2003. Commercial mortgage securitizations have also\nproliferated noticeably since the early 1990s. The dollar amount of outstanding securities backed by\ncommercial and multifamily mortgages has risen from $36 billion at the end of 1989 to just under\n$450 billion as of this past September. In addition, commercial banks and finance companies have\nmoved business loans off their books through the development of collateralized debt obligations.\nSecuritized business loans amounted to $100 billion in the third quarter of 2003, up from a relatively\nminiscule $2 billion in 1989.\nFirms also use derivatives to manage their risk exposures to price fluctuations in currency, commodity,\nenergy, and interest rate markets. More recently, firms have used credit derivatives, a relatively new\ntype of derivative that allows them to purchase protection against the risk of loss from the default of a\ngiven entity. By purchasing such protection, financial and nonfinancial firms alike can reduce their\nexposures to particular borrowers or counterparties. Credit derivatives also allow financial firms to\nachieve a more diversified credit portfolio by acquiring credit exposure to borrowers with which they do\nnot have a lending relationship. For example, European insurance companies reportedly have used\ncredit derivatives to acquire exposure to European corporations that, because they rely primarily on\nbank lending, have little publicly traded debt outstanding.\nThe improvements in technology, the quick pace of financial innovation, and the evolving\nriskmanagement techniques almost ensure that businesses will increasingly use almost limitless\nconfigurations of products and services and sophisticated financial structures. Accordingly, outsiders\nwill have ever more difficulty understanding the risk positions of many large, complex organizations.\nThese developments represent significant challenges to standard setters and to firms. For market\ndiscipline to be effective, accounting standards must evolve to accurately capture these developments.\nCompany managers must also do their part, by ensuring that public disclosures clearly identify all\nsignificant risk exposures - whether on or off the balance sheet - and their effects on the firm's\nfinancial condition and performance, cash flow, and earnings potential. With regard to securitizations,\nderivatives, and other innovative risk transfer instruments, accounting measurement of a company's\nbalance sheet at a point in time is insufficient to convey the full effect of a company's financial risk\nprofile. Therefore, disclosures about how risks are being managed and the underlying basis for values\nand other estimates must be included in financial reports.\nUnlike typical accounting reports, information generated by risk management tends to be oriented less\nto a particular time and more to a description of the risks. To take an example from the world of\nbanking, in which the discipline of risk management is relatively well developed, a fair value report\nmight say that the value of a loan portfolio is $300 million and has dropped $10 million from the\nprevious report. However, the bank's internal risk report would show much more extensive information,\nsuch as the interest rates on the loans, the credit quality of the underlying assets, and the range of\nvalues the portfolio would take under alternative future scenarios. Thus, unlike a user of the fair value\nreport, the user of a risk-management report could determine whether the fall in value was due to\ndeclining credit quality, rising interest rates, or sales or payoffs of loans. Corporate risk officers have\ndeveloped other types of reports that provide information on the extent to which the total return in a\nparticular line of business compensates for the line's comprehensive risk. A reader of such a report\ncan determine whether the growing lines of business have risk exposures that tend to offset those in\nother business lines - thereby resulting in lower volatility for the earnings of the corporation as a whole.\nI particularly want to emphasize that disclosure need not be in a standard framework nor exactly the\nsame for all organizations. Rather, we should all be insisting that each entity disclose the information\nthat its investors need in order to evaluate the entity's risk profile in the most convenient and useful\nway. And we should keep in mind that disclosure without context may not be meaningful.\nTransparency means that the information presented provides an accurate understanding of the entity's\ntransactions.\nTo achieve greater transparency, organizations should continue to improve their risk management and\nreporting functions. When they are comfortable with the reliability and consistency of the information in\nthese reports, they should begin disclosing this information to the market, perhaps in summary form,\npaying due attention to the need for keeping proprietary business data confidential. Disclosures would\nnot only provide more qualitative and quantitative information about the firm's current risk exposure to\nthe market but also help the market assess the quality of the risk oversight and risk appetite of the\norganization.\nLess than fully transparent disclosures are not limited to \"complex\" off-balance-sheet transactions.\nOne glaring example is the treatment of expenses associated with defined-benefit pension plans. In\nrecent years we have seen how the accounting rules for these plans can produce, quite frankly, some\nvery misleading measures of corporate earnings and balance sheets. In effect, firms use expectations\nof the long-term return on assets in defined-benefit plans to calculate current-period pension costs\n(income) while disguising the volatility actually occurring in the portfolio. At the same time, they use a\nspot rate to discount the future liabilities. This accounting is reconciled with economic reality by\ngradual amortization of the discrepancies between the assumed and the actual returns experienced\non pension assets. As many of you are aware, this smoothing feature can create very large distortions\nbetween economic reality and the pension-financing cost accruals embedded in the income statement.\nMoreover, a recent study by Federal Reserve staff indicates that \"full disclosure\" of the underlying\ndetails, by itself, does not appear to be a panacea.1 The study adopts the premise that most of what\ninvestors need to know about the true pension-financing costs, not the mixed attribute accounting\ncosts, can be reflected in two numbers disclosed in the pension footnote. These two numbers are the\nfair market value of pension assets and the present value of outstanding pension liabilities. The study\nfinds that these direct measures of pension assets and liabilities tend to be ignored by investors in\nfavor of the potentially misleading accounting measures, and as a result, the average firm with a\ndefined-benefit plan in 2001 may have been 5 percent to 10 percent overvalued relative to an\notherwise similar firm without a defined-benefit plan.\nIn general, the test for useful disclosure should be the following questions: Are the firm and its\naccountants providing investors with what is needed to accurately evaluate the financial position of the\nfirm and the risks that it faces? And is the information provided in a manner that facilitates accurate\nassessments by investors? Ultimately, improved transparency would benefit corporations by reducing\nuncertainty about the value of their securities, which would lower the cost of, and increase access to,\nmarket funding.\nIn the past few years, capital markets have shown themselves to be a powerful force in disciplining\nand rewarding firms. In the summer of 2002, after corporate bond investors had been badly burned by\nover-leveraged telecommunication firms and a wave of corporate accounting scandals, risk spreads\non corporate bonds ballooned toward record levels. However, substantial declines in risk spreads of\ncorporate bonds over the past year reflect the increased emphasis on corporate governance and audit\nquality and stronger corporate balance sheets accomplished through lengthening the average maturity\nof liabilities and de-leveraging. These narrower debt spreads have significantly reduced the cost of\ncapital to firms, particularly at the lower end of the credit quality spectrum, where the average risk\nspread on junk-rated corporate bonds has fallen about 700 basis points, to its lowest level since\nmid-1998.\nFinancing patterns and corporate governance\nBesides the changes in transparency to which I have already alluded, another key development\naffecting corporate governance has been the increasing portion of public equity held by institutional\ninvestors on behalf of households. According to the Flow of Funds accounts published by the Federal\nReserve, the combined share of corporate equity managed by mutual funds, pension funds, and life\ninsurance companies grew from only 3 percent in 1952 to 48 percent by the third quarter of 2003, the\nlatest period for which data are now available. As of that date, pension funds held 21 percent of\ncorporate equity in the United States. Mutual funds held another 21 percent, and life insurance\ncompanies held 6 percent, mainly through separate accounts that, in effect, were mutual funds with\ninsurance wrappers.\nThese changes are indeed dramatic, but it is not obvious whether we should be comforted or\nconcerned that an increasing share of corporate equity is in the hands of institutional investors. A\nprimary issue is whether institutional investors are more \"active shareholders\" than individual\ninvestors. That is, compared with individual investors - especially those with large holdings - are\ninstitutional investors more likely to actively monitor and influence both management actions and\ncorporate governance mechanisms at the firms in which they invest? Shareholder activism may\nprovide market discipline directly by preventing management from pursuing its own interests at the\nexpense of shareholders. Shareholder activism may also pave the way for other forms of market\ndiscipline - such as corporate takeovers and changes in share prices and funding costs - by\neliminating management-takeover protections and by inducing greater transparency.\nUnfortunately, whether institutional investors have more or less incentive to be activist shareholders\nthan individual investors is not clear. On the one hand, because institutional investors make large\ninvestments in companies, they will have more bargaining power with company management than\nindividual investors have, and they will derive more benefits from mitigating corporate malfeasance\nthan individual investors will. Among institutional investors, pension funds and insurance companies\nare thought to benefit the most from shareholder activism because they tend to have relatively\nlongterm investment horizons.\nOn the other hand, managers of index mutual funds may have little interest in shareholder activism\nsince they merely adjust their holdings when the mix of the index changes and want only to follow the\nindex, not influence it. In addition, mutual funds and pension funds may have conflicts of interest that\nencourage passivity. Activism by a mutual fund complex or a pension fund manager could strain its\nrelationships with corporate clients. For example, a fund manager bidding for the management of a\nfirm's 401(k) plan may be reluctant to vote against the board of directors' proxy recommendations.\nIn practice, institutional investors appear to have been relatively passive shareholders, in the sense\nthat they have tended to initiate relatively few reform proposals. Before the past twenty years, most\nreform proposals were submitted by a handful of individuals and religious groups. Since the\nmid-1980s, some institutional investors - mainly large public pension funds and a few union funds -\nhave stepped up to the plate and offered their own proposals, but corporate pension funds, mutual\nfunds, and insurance companies have remained on the sidelines.\nAppearances can be misleading, however. Some institutional investors are active behind the scenes,\npreferring direct contact with the management of the firms in their portfolios to indirect action through\nreform proposals. Moreover, passive institutional investors may still benefit shareholders as a whole\nby facilitating the building of shareholder coalitions that are initiated by others or by posing a possible\nthreat to managers who might fail to act in the interest of shareholders. In addition, there have been\nreports that institutional shareholders are picking up the pace of their activism. For instance, according\nto the Investor Responsibility Research Center, labor union funds initiated a record number of\nshareholder proposals in 2003. And institutional shareholder activism may soon receive a boost from a\nrule that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has proposed to increase the power of\ninstitutional investors. The rule specifies circumstances under which shareholders with at least\n5 percent of outstanding shares, held for at least two years, must be allowed by management to\npublish nominations for board members on the company's proxy statement. However, increasing\nshareholder access to the proxy statement may not be without costs. Some have argued that the\ndemocratization of the nomination process may pave the way for special interests to undermine the\ngoal of maximizing shareholder value.\nUltimately, the question of whether institutional investors mitigate corporate governance problems is\nan empirical one. Academic work in this area has not convincingly linked institutional holdings to firm\nperformance. But some studies have shown that institutional shareholder activism does appear to be\nmotivated by efforts to increase shareholder value, and other studies have confirmed that institutional\nactivism is associated with a greater incidence of corporate governance events, such as shareholder\nlawsuits and corporate takeovers. Based on these findings, it would be premature to conclude that the\nrising share of corporate equity held by institutional investors is clearly good in terms of sound\ncorporate governance. That said, believing that institutional shareholder activism has benefits and that\nthese benefits may help pave the way for market discipline in a broader sense does seem reasonable.\nCorporate governance at mutual funds\nPerhaps another reason for being cautious about the benefits of institutional ownership is that\ninstitutional investors have their own governance problems. As you are no doubt aware, such\nproblems at mutual funds have been manifest in headlines over the past year. I would now like to\ndiscuss both the conflicts of interest that lie at the heart of many of the recent mutual fund scandals\nand the responses by investors and regulators.\nArguably the most fundamental conflict of interest at mutual funds occurs because the compensation\nof mutual fund managers and management companies is generally tied to the value of the assets they\nmanage. As a result, managers have an incentive to attract cash, and they may do so by methods\nwhich impose costs on long-term shareholders. For example, as was heralded in the press, a few\nmutual fund firms allowed late traders to exploit stale share prices by rapidly trading mutual fund\nshares. Long-term shareholders suffered reduced investment returns, but management companies\ncollected extra fees on the \"hot money\" while it was in their funds. Importantly, long-term investors\nwere not informed of these deals.\nAnother method for attracting cash is to compensate mutual fund brokers for bringing in new money.\nSo-called \"directed brokerage\", for example, is a means of rewarding a broker who sells mutual fund\nshares by giving the broker a slice of the fund's securities trading business. Such compensation\narrangements clearly give brokers an incentive to sell these mutual funds regardless of whether the\nfunds are appropriate for their clients. What is particularly troubling about these \"kick-backed\"\ncommissions is that most shareholders never learn about them, since portfolio securities trading costs\nare not included in the expense ratios and fee summaries that mutual funds publish in their\nprospectuses and annual reports.\nA related problem is \"soft dollars\", which allow mutual fund portfolio managers to pay brokers for a\nbundled combination of trade execution and \"research\" services. Like directed brokerage costs, soft\ndollars are lumped into the costs of trading portfolio securities and are not disclosed up front in mutual\nfund fee summaries, so they are virtually invisible to most investors. The definition of soft-dollar\nresearch is quite broad, so an investment adviser can purchase Wall Street Journal subscriptions and\nBloomberg accounts with soft dollars, without reporting these costs to shareholders. In short,\nsoftdollar arrangements are ripe for abuse, and the SEC is now considering whether to impose new\nrestrictions on their use and to require more meaningful disclosure of their cost to investors.\nOf course, mutual fund managers are not the only ones to blame for the mutual fund scandals. Late\ntrading, which illegally diluted the returns of long-term investors in mutual funds, was accomplished\nprimarily with the help of brokers and intermediaries. So we must keep in mind that the problems and\ntheir solutions involve more than just the firms that operate mutual funds.\nNot surprisingly, the breadth of the scandal and the cost to investors has led many to reassess the\nbenefits of owning mutual funds. One-third of respondents to a recent Gallup survey indicated that the\nscandal had made them less likely to invest in mutual funds, and three-quarters said they would pull\nassets out of a mutual fund complex that admitted to wrongdoing. The scandal has also affected\ninstitutional investors, such as pension-fund sponsors, whose fiduciary duties require them to assess\nwhether a particular investment is prudent and in the interest of plan participants and beneficiaries.\nBoth retail and institutional investors have pulled back sharply from some investment management\ncompanies where abuses occurred. Yet, mutual fund investors have shown little, if any, aggregate net\nreaction, perhaps because investors pulled cash out of funds with problems and reinvested it in other\nmutual funds. In the three months before September, when the New York Attorney General first\npublicly described the trading abuses, $56 billion on net was invested in long-term mutual funds. Net\ninvestment actually increased in the next three months, to $59 billion.\nWhy didn't the scandal cause a large pullback from the mutual fund industry? The recent strength of\nthe stock market is part of the explanation. And to be sure, many mutual funds have remained\nuntainted by the scandal, and some of them received a disproportionate share of the new cash\ninvested in mutual funds in recent months. But mutual funds have maintained their position in U.S.\nfamilies' portfolios primarily because they continue to offer low-cost access to highly liquid, diversified\nportfolios. The lasting importance of mutual funds for so many U.S. households makes it all the more\npressing that the problems arising from these conflicts of interest be addressed.\nAddressing these problems, however, is proving to be a difficult task. Each month the scope of the\nWall Street Journal's\nscandal seems to grow. The \"Mutual Fund Scandal Scorecard\" now lists sixteen\nmutual fund complexes, nine brokerage firms, three hedge funds, and a bank. As the roster has\nexpanded and new forms of malfeasance have come to light, the list of suggested reforms has itself\nbecome rather lengthy.\nConsider first the reforms that are intended to combat market timing of mutual funds. Ironically, the\nscandal headlines have publicized the profitability of market timing, so rule changes are urgently\nneeded to prevent additional dilution. One interesting proposal would be to allow mutual funds to\nadopt, voluntarily, a delayed-pricing rule, under which transactions today would receive tomorrow's\nmarket-close prices. Long-term investors who wish to avoid market-timing dilution could purchase\nshares of delayed-pricing funds, and investors who want same-day pricing could purchase shares of\nfunds that price by current rules.\nOther reforms are aimed at strengthening governance structures. The SEC recently adopted new rules\nrequiring each mutual fund to adopt formal compliance procedures and to have a chief compliance\nofficer who reports directly to the fund's independent directors. By centralizing the responsibility for\ncompliance in one officer's hands, the rules should improve mutual funds' internal controls and give\nshareholders' interests an authoritative voice within the management company. I hope that measures\nlike this will end some of the more egregious breakdowns of internal controls at mutual funds, such as\nthe situations in which marketing departments overruled portfolio managers in allowing late trades of\nmutual funds.\nProposed rules mandating greater strength and independence for mutual fund boards might also give\ngreater weight to shareholders' interests in mutual fund decision-making. But it is worth noting that\ngovernance reforms alone may not accomplish much. One mutual fund family, for example, has an\nindependent chairman and a board that is 80 percent independent. Yet this firm is alleged to have\ntolerated some of the industry's worst abuses.\nThe transparency of mutual funds is also being addressed. Recent SEC and congressional proposals\nwould require mutual funds to disclose their fees in dollars, explain in writing why fees are reasonable,\nreport the costs incurred to trade portfolio securities, and disclose policies on handling market timers.\nAnd a recent reform proposal published by the SEC only a few weeks ago would mandate the type\nand format of disclosures to clients that a broker would need to make about the compensation he or\nshe would receive for selling a particular mutual fund.\nAlthough I applaud these moves toward enhanced disclosure and increased transparency, I have\nconcerns similar to those expressed earlier about the difficulties of rules-based accounting. In\nparticular, the relationship between mutual funds and brokers has become extraordinarily complex and\nlucrative. Further, as financial innovation continues, conflicts of interest will continue to arise.\nEnterprise-wide risk management\nOne of the challenges the Federal Reserve System has as the umbrella supervisor of financial holding\ncompanies is to encourage the evolution of corporate governance within organizations that keeps\npace with changing business strategies. Earlier in my remarks I referred to the challenges to investors,\nmanagers, and boards of directors in understanding complex organizations. As supervisors, we have\nsimilar challenges in monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of corporate governance,\ncompliance, and internal controls in financial institutions. Further, as risk exposures change, we need\nto modify the capital rules for banking organizations to better reflect the diversity of their risk\nexposures.\nOne common theme that has recurred in the scandals of the past two years - whether it is Enron,\nArthur Anderson, Tyco, stock research, mutual fund trading, or Parmalat - is that the interest of\nindividual officers can easily conflict with that of the firm as a whole. Many times the problem results\nfrom the failure to identify conflicts of interest among various lines of business. Too often firms are\ngoverned through silos by individual lines of business without a comprehensive risk review by\nexecutive officers and the appropriate committee of the board of directors.\nFinancial institutions are being encouraged to establish enterprise-wide risk management functions to\nensure that risks of all types, including conflicts of interest, are identified; risk appetites are defined;\nappropriate mitigating controls are effective; and exceptions are rigorously reviewed at a high level\nwithin the organization. Enterprise-wide risk management is also rapidly developing at nonfinancial\nfirms. Later this year, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission will\nissue a framework for effective risk management that is versatile enough for all types and sizes of\nfirms to use. Risk management and good corporate governance should be thought of as more than\nexpense centers. If these functions are effectively managed, they can mitigate losses and reduce\nsurprises to the market that can disrupt customer relationships, increase the cost of capital, and\ntarnish the reputation of the firm. Further, as in any corporate function, focusing on the risks in what is\ndone day-to-day can help identify opportunities to improve operations.\nConclusion\nEnterprise-wide risk-management and stronger internal governance structures are needed. However,\nthe mutual fund scandal reminds us that monitors, even boards of directors, may have their own\ngovernance problems. Full and meaningful disclosure will always be crucial for limiting the ability of\ncompanies to pursue their own interest at the expense of investors. Indeed, many of the problems\nuncovered at mutual funds and in the corporate world can be traced to relationships or transactions\nthat were hidden from view. I am confident that greater transparency will provide the foundation for\nmore effective corporate governance in the future.",

         "Ben S Bernanke: The great moderation\nRemarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the meetings of the Eastern Economic Association, Washington DC, 20 February 2004.\nThe references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.\n* * *\nOne of the most striking features of the economic landscape over the past twenty years or so has\nbeen a substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility. In a recent article, Olivier Blanchard and John\nSimon (2001) documented that the variability of quarterly growth in real output (as measured by its\nstandard deviation) has declined by half since the mid-1980s, while the variability of quarterly inflation\nhas declined by about two thirds.1 Several writers on the topic have dubbed this remarkable decline in\nthe variability of both output and inflation \"the Great Moderation\". Similar declines in the volatility of\noutput and inflation occurred at about the same time in other major industrial countries, with the recent\nexception of Japan, a country that has faced a distinctive set of economic problems in the past\ndecade.\nReduced macroeconomic volatility has numerous benefits. Lower volatility of inflation improves market\nfunctioning, makes economic planning easier, and reduces the resources devoted to hedging inflation\nrisks. Lower volatility of output tends to imply more stable employment and a reduction in the extent of\neconomic uncertainty confronting households and firms. The reduction in the volatility of output is also\nclosely associated with the fact that recessions have become less frequent and less severe.2\nWhy has macroeconomic volatility declined? Three types of explanations have been suggested for this\ndramatic change; for brevity, I will refer to these classes of explanations as structural change,\nimproved macroeconomic policies, and good luck. Explanations focusing on structural change suggest\nthat changes in economic institutions, technology, business practices, or other structural features of\nthe economy have improved the ability of the economy to absorb shocks. Some economists have\nargued, for example, that improved management of business inventories, made possible by advances\nin computation and communication, has reduced the amplitude of fluctuations in inventory stocks,\nwhich in earlier decades played an important role in cyclical fluctuations.3 The increased depth and\nsophistication of financial markets, deregulation in many industries, the shift away from manufacturing\ntoward services, and increased openness to trade and international capital flows are other examples\nof structural changes that may have increased macroeconomic flexibility and stability.\nThe second class of explanations focuses on the arguably improved performance of macroeconomic\npolicies, particularly monetary policy. The historical pattern of changes in the volatilities of output\ngrowth and inflation gives some credence to the idea that better monetary policy may have been a\nmajor contributor to increased economic stability. As Blanchard and Simon (2001) show, output\nvolatility and inflation volatility have had a strong tendency to move together, both in the United States\nand other industrial countries. In particular, output volatility in the United States, at a high level in the\nimmediate postwar era, declined significantly between 1955 and 1970, a period in which inflation\nvolatility was low. Both output volatility and inflation volatility rose significantly in the 1970s and early\n1980s and, as I have noted, both fell sharply after about 1984. Economists generally agree that the\n1970s, the period of highest volatility in both output and inflation, was also a period in which monetary\npolicy performed quite poorly, relative to both earlier and later periods (Romer and Romer, 2002).4\nFew disagree that monetary policy has played a large part in stabilizing inflation, and so the fact that\noutput volatility has declined in parallel with inflation volatility, both in the United States and abroad,\nsuggests that monetary policy may have helped moderate the variability of output as well.\nThe third class of explanations suggests that the Great Moderation did not result primarily from\nchanges in the structure of the economy or improvements in policymaking but occurred because the\nshocks hitting the economy became smaller and more infrequent. In other words, the reduction in\ngood\nmacroeconomic volatility we have lately enjoyed is largely the result of luck, not an intrinsically\nmore stable economy or better policies. Several prominent studies using distinct empirical approaches\nhave provided support for the good-luck hypothesis (Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson, 2002; Stock and\nWatson, 2003).\nExplanations of complicated phenomena are rarely clear cut and simple, and each of the three classes\nof explanations I have described probably contains elements of truth. Nevertheless, sorting out the\nrelative importance of these explanations is of more than purely historical interest. Notably, if the Great\nModeration was largely the result of good luck rather than a more stable economy or better policies,\nthen we have no particular reason to expect the relatively benign economic environment of the past\ntwenty years to continue. Indeed, if the good-luck hypothesis is true, it is entirely possible that the\nvariability of output growth and inflation in the United States may, at some point, return to the levels of\nthe 1970s. If instead the Great Moderation was the result of structural change or improved\npolicymaking, then the increase in stability should be more likely to persist, assuming of course that\npolicymakers do not forget the lessons of history.\nMy view is that improvements in monetary policy, though certainly not the only factor, have probably\nbeen an important source of the Great Moderation. In particular, I am not convinced that the decline in\nprimarily\nmacroeconomic volatility of the past two decades was the result of good luck, as some have\nargued, though I am sure good luck had its part to play as well. In the remainder of my remarks, I will\nprovide some support for the \"improved-monetary-policy\" explanation for the Great Moderation. I will\nnot spend much time on the other two classes of explanations, not because they are uninteresting or\nunimportant, but because my time is limited and the structural change and good-luck hypotheses have\nbeen extensively discussed elsewhere.5 Before proceeding, I should note that my views are not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\nThe Taylor curve and the variability tradeoff\nLet us begin by asking what economic theory has to say about the relationship of output volatility and\ninflation volatility. To keep matters simple, I will make the strong (but only temporary!) assumption that\nmonetary policymakers have an accurate understanding of the economy and that they choose policies\nto promote the best economic performance possible, given their economic objectives. I also assume\nfor the moment that the structure of the economy and the distribution of economic shocks are stable\nand unchanging. Under these baseline assumptions, macroeconomists have obtained an interesting\nand important result. Specifically, standard economic models imply that, in the long run, monetary\nonly\npolicymakers can reduce the volatility of inflation by allowing greater volatility in output growth,\nand vice versa. In other words, if monetary policies are chosen optimally and the economic structure is\nheld constant, there exists a long-run tradeoff between volatility in output and volatility in inflation.\nThe ultimate source of this long-run tradeoff is the existence of shocks to aggregate supply. Consider\nthe canonical example of an aggregate supply shock, a sharp rise in oil prices caused by disruptions\nto foreign sources of supply. According to conventional analysis, an increase in the price of oil raises\nthe overall price level (a temporary burst in inflation) while depressing output and employment.\nMonetary policymakers are therefore faced with a difficult choice. If they choose to tighten policy (raise\nthe short-term interest rate) in order to offset the effects of the oil price shock on the general price\nlevel, they may well succeed - but only at the cost of making the decline in output more severe.\nLikewise, if monetary policymakers choose to ease in order to mitigate the effects of the oil price shock\non output, their action will exacerbate the inflationary impact. Hence, in the standard framework, the\nperiodic occurrence of shocks to aggregate supply (such as oil price shocks) forces policymakers to\nchoose between stabilizing output and stabilizing inflation.6 Note that shocks to aggregate demand do\nnot create the same tradeoff, as offsetting an aggregate demand shock stabilizes both output and\ninflation.\nThis apparent tradeoff between output variability and inflation variability faced by policymakers gives\nrise to what has been dubbed the Taylor curve, reflecting early work by the Stanford economist and\ncurrent Undersecretary of the Treasury John B. Taylor.7 (Taylor also originated the eponymous Taylor\nrule, to which I will refer later.) Graphically, the Taylor curve depicts the menu of possible\ncombinations of output volatility and inflation volatility from which monetary policymakers can choose\nin the long run. Figure 1 shows two examples of Taylor curves, marked TC1 and TC2. In Figure 1,\nvolatility in output is measured on the vertical axis and volatility in inflation is measured on the\nhorizontal axis. As shown in the figure, Taylor curves slope downward, reflecting the theoretical\nconclusion that an optimizing policymaker can choose less of one type of volatility in the long run only\nby accepting more of the other.8 A direct implication of the Taylor curve framework is that a change in\nthe preferences or objectives of the central bank alone - a decision to be tougher on inflation, for\nexample - cannot explain the Great Moderation. Indeed, in this framework, a conscious attempt by\npolicymakers to try to moderate the variability of inflation should lead to higher, not lower, variability of\noutput.\nHow, then, can the Great Moderation be explained? Figure 1 suggests two possibilities. First, suppose\nit were the case, contrary to what we assumed in deriving the Taylor curve, that monetary policies\nduring the period of high macroeconomic volatility were not optimal, perhaps because policymakers\ndid not have an accurate understanding of the structure of the economy or of the impact of their policy\nactions. If monetary policies during the late 1960s and the 1970s were sufficiently far from optimal, the\nresult could be a combination of output volatility and inflation volatility lying well above the efficient\nfrontier defined by the Taylor curve. Graphically, suppose that the true Taylor curve is the solid curve\nshown in Figure 1, labeled TC2. Then, in principle, sufficiently well executed policies could achieve a\ncombination of output volatility and inflation volatility such as that represented by point B, which lies on\nthat curve. However, less effective policies could lead to the economic outcome represented by\nA\npoint in Figure 1, at which both output volatility and inflation volatility are higher than at point B. We\ncan see now how improvements in monetary policy might account for the Great Moderation, even in\nthe absence of any change in the structure of the economy or in the underlying shocks. Improvements\nin the policy framework, in policy implementation, or in the policymakers' understanding of the\neconomy could allow the economy to move from the inefficient point A to the efficient point B, where\nthe volatility of both inflation and output are more moderate.\nFigure 1 can also be used to depict a second possible explanation for the Great Moderation, which is\nthat, rather than monetary policy having improved, the underlying economic environment may have\nbecome more stable. Changes in the structure of the economy that increased its resilience to shocks\nor reductions in the variance of the shocks themselves would improve the volatility tradeoff faced by\npolicymakers. In Figure 1, we can imagine now that the true Taylor curve in the 1970s is given by the\ndashed curve, TC1, and the actual economic outcome chosen by policymakers is point A, which lies\non TC1. Improved economic stability in the 1980s and 1990s, whether arising from structural change\nor good luck, can be represented by a shift of the Taylor curve from TC1 to TC2, and the new\nTC2\neconomic outcome as determined by policy is point B. Relative to TC1, the Taylor curve\nrepresents economic outcomes with lower volatility in output for any given volatility of inflation, and\nvice versa. According to the \"shifting Taylor curve\" explanation, the Great Moderation resulted not from\nimproved practice of monetary policy (which has always been as effective as possible, given the\nenvironment) but rather by favorable structural change or reduced variability of economic shocks. Of\nand\ncourse, more complicated scenarios in which policy becomes more effective the underlying\neconomic environment becomes more stable are possible and indeed likely.\nWith this bit of theory as background, I will focus on two key points. First, without claiming that\nmonetary policy during the 1950s or in the period since 1984 has been ideal by any means, I will try to\nsupport my view that the policies of the late 1960s and 1970s were particularly inefficient, for reasons\nthat I think we now understand. Thus, as in the first scenario just discussed (represented in Figure 1\nA\nas a movement from point to point B), improvements in the execution of monetary policy can\nplausibly account for a significant part of the Great Moderation. Second, more subtly, I will argue that\nsome of the benefits of improved monetary policy may easily be confused with changes in the\nunderlying environment (that is, improvements in policy may be incorrectly identified as shifts in the\nTaylor curve), increasing the risk that standard statistical methods of analyzing this question could\nunderstate the contribution of monetary policy to the Great Moderation.\nReaching the Taylor curve: improvements in the effectiveness of monetary policy\nMonetary policymakers face difficult challenges in their efforts to stabilize the economy. We are\nuncertain about many aspects of the workings of the economy, including the channels by which the\neffects of monetary policy are transmitted. We are even uncertain about the current economic situation\nas economic data are received with a lag, are typically subject to multiple revisions, and in any case\ncan only roughly and partially depict the underlying economic reality. Thus, in practice, monetary\npolicy will never achieve as much reduction in macroeconomic volatility as would be possible if our\nunderstanding were more complete.\nNevertheless, a number of economists have argued that monetary policy during the late 1960s and\nthe 1970s was unusually prone to creating volatility, relative to both earlier and later periods (DeLong,\n1997; Mayer, 1998; Romer and Romer, 2002). Economic historians have suggested that the relative\ninefficiency of policy during this period arose because monetary policymakers labored under some\nimportant misconceptions about policy and the economy. First, during this period, central bankers\nseemed to have been excessively optimistic about the ability of activist monetary policies to offset\nshocks to output and to deliver permanently low levels of unemployment. Second, monetary\npolicymakers appeared to underestimate their own contributions to the inflationary problems of the\ntime, believing instead that inflation was in large part the result of nonmonetary forces. One might say\nthat, in terms of their ability to deliver good macroeconomic outcomes, policymakers suffered from\nexcessive \"output optimism\" and \"inflation pessimism.\"\nThe output optimism of the late 1960s and the 1970s had several aspects. First, at least during the\nearly part of that period, many economists and policymakers held the view that policy could exploit a\npermanent tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, as described by a simple Phillips curve\nrelationship. The idea of a permanent tradeoff opened up the beguiling possibility that, in return for\naccepting just a bit more inflation, policymakers could deliver a permanently low rate of\nunemployment. This view is now discredited, of course, on both theoretical and empirical grounds.9\nSecond, estimates of the rate of unemployment that could be sustained without igniting inflation were\ntypically unrealistically low, with a long-term unemployment rate of 4 percent or less often being\ncharacterized as a modest and easily attainable objective.10 Third, economists of the time may have\nbeen unduly optimistic about the ability of fiscal and monetary policymakers to eliminate short-term\nfluctuations in output and employment, that is, to \"fine-tune\" the economy.\nWhat I have called inflation pessimism was the increasing conviction of policymakers in the 1960s and\n1970s, as inflation rose and remained stubbornly high, that monetary policy was an ineffective tool for\ncontrolling inflation. As emphasized in recent work on the United States and the United Kingdom by\nEdward Nelson (2004), during this period policymakers became more and more inclined to blame\ninflation on so-called cost-push shocks rather than on monetary forces. Cost-push shocks, in the\nparadigm of the time, included diverse factors such as union wage pressures, price increases by\noligopolistic firms, and increases in the prices of commodities such as oil and beef brought about by\nadverse changes in supply conditions. For the purpose of understanding the upward trend in inflation,\nhowever, the most salient attribute of cost-push shocks was that they were putatively out of the control\nof the monetary policymakers.\nThe combination of output optimism and inflation pessimism during the latter part of the 1960s and the\n1970s was a recipe for high volatility in output and inflation - that is, a set of outcomes well away from\nthe efficient frontier represented by the economy's Taylor curve. Notably, the belief in a long-run\ntradeoff between output and inflation, together with an unrealistically low assessment of the\nsustainable rate of unemployment, resulted in high inflation but did not deliver the expected payoff in\nterms of higher output and employment. Moreover, the Fed's periodic attempts to rein in surging\ninflation led to a pattern of \"go-stop\" policies, in which swings in policy from ease to tightness\ncontributed to a highly volatile real economy as well as a highly variable inflation rate. Wage-price\ncontrols, invoked in the belief that monetary policy was ineffective against cost-push forces, also\nultimately proved destabilizing.\nMonetary policymakers bemoaned the high rate of inflation in the 1970s but did not fully appreciate\ntheir own role in its creation. Ironically, their errors in estimating the natural rate and in ascribing\ninflation to nonmonetary forces were mutually reinforcing. On the one hand, because unemployment\nremained well above their over-optimistic estimates of the sustainable rate, they were inclined to\nattribute inflation to outside forces (such as the actions of firms and unions) rather than to an\noverheated economy (Romer and Romer, 2002; Nelson, 2004). On the other hand, the view of\npolicymakers that exogenous forces largely drove inflation made it more difficult for them to recognize\nthat their estimate of the sustainable rate of unemployment was too low. Several years passed before\npolicymakers were finally persuaded by the evidence that sustained anti-inflationary monetary policies\nwould actually work (Primiceri, 2003). As you know, these policies were implemented successfully\nafter 1979, beginning under Fed Chairman Volcker.\nBetter known than even the Taylor curve is John Taylor's famous Taylor rule, a simple equation that\nhas proved remarkably useful as a rule-of-thumb description of monetary policy (Taylor, 1993). In its\nbasic form, the Taylor rule relates the Federal Reserve's policy instrument, the overnight federal funds\ninterest rate, to the deviations of inflation and output from the central bank's desired levels for those\nvariables. Estimates of the Taylor rule for the late 1960s and the 1970s reflect the output optimism and\ninflation pessimism of the period, in that researchers tend to find a weaker response of the policy rate\nto inflation and (in some studies) a relatively stronger response to the output gap than in more recent\nperiods.11 As I will shortly discuss further, an insufficiently strong response to inflation let inflation and\ninflation expectations get out of control and thus added volatility to the economy. At the same time,\nstrong responses to what we understand in retrospect to have been over-optimistic estimates of the\noutput gap created additional instability. As output optimism and inflation pessimism both waned under\nthe force of the data, policy responses became more appropriate and the economy more stable. In this\nsense, improvements in policymakers' understanding of the economy and the role of monetary policy\nA\nallowed the economy to move closer to the Taylor curve (or, in terms of Figure 1, to move from point\nto point B).\nImproved monetary policy or a shifting Taylor curve?\nImprovements in monetary policy that moved the economy closer to the efficient frontier described by\nthe Taylor curve can account for part of the Great Moderation. However, several empirical studies\nhave questioned the quantitative importance of this effect and emphasized instead shifts in the Taylor\ncurve, brought about by structural change or good luck. For example, in a paper presented at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual Jackson Hole conference, James Stock and Mark\nWatson (2003) use several alternative macroeconomic models to simulate how the economy would\nhave performed after 1984 if monetary policy had followed its pre-1979 pattern. Although inflation\nperformance after 1984 would clearly have been worse if pre-1979 monetary policies had been used,\nStock and Watson find that output volatility would have been little different. They conclude that\nimproved monetary policy does not account for much of the reduction in output volatility since the\nmid-1980s. Instead, noting that the variance of the economic shocks implied by their models for the\n1970s was much higher than the variance of shocks in the more recent period, they embrace the\ngood-luck explanation of the Great Moderation. Interesting research by Timothy Cogley and Thomas\nSargent (2002) and by Shaghil Ahmed, Andrew Levin, and Beth Anne Wilson (2002) likewise find a\nsubstantial reduction in the size and frequency of shocks in the more recent period, supporting the\ngood-luck hypothesis.\nBoth the structural change and good-luck explanations of the Great Moderation are intriguing and (to\nreiterate) both are no doubt part of the story. However, an unsatisfying aspect of both explanations is\nthe difficulty of identifying changes in the economic environment large enough and persistent enough\nto explain the Great Moderation, both in the United States and abroad. In particular, it is not obvious\nthat economic shocks have become significantly smaller or more infrequent, as required by the\ngoodluck hypothesis. Tensions in the Middle East, often blamed for the oil price shocks of the 1970s, have\nhardly declined in recent years, and important developments in technology and productivity have\ncontinued to buffet the economy (albeit in a more positive direction than in the 1970s). Nor has the\ninternational economic environment become obviously more placid, as a series of financial crises\nstruck various regions of the world during the 1990s and the powerful forces of globalization have\nproceeded apace. In contrast, following the adverse experience of the 1970s, changes in the practice\nof monetary policy occurred around the world in similar ways and during approximately the same\nperiod.\nCertainly, stability-enhancing changes in the economic environment have occurred in the past two\ndecades. However, an intriguing possibility is that some of these changes, rather than being truly\nexogenous, may have been induced by improved monetary policies. That is, better monetary policies\nmay have resulted in what appear to be (but only appear to be) favorable shifts in the economy's\nTaylor curve. Here are some examples of what I have in mind.\nFirst, monetary policies that brought down and stabilized inflation may have led to stabilizing changes\nin the structure of the economy as well, in line with the prediction of the famous Lucas (1976) critique\nthat economic structure depends on the policy regime. High and unstable inflation increases the\nvariability of relative prices and real interest rates, for example, distorting decisions regarding\nconsumption, capital investment, and inventory investment, among others. Likewise, the high level,\nvariability, and unpredictability of inflation profoundly affected decisions regarding financial\ninvestments and money holdings. Theories of \"rational inattention\" (Sims, 2003), according to which\npeople vary the frequency with which they re-examine economic decisions according to the underlying\neconomic environment, imply that the dynamic behavior of the economy would change - probably in\nthe direction of greater stability and persistence - in a more stable pricing environment, in which\npeople reconsider their economic decisions less frequently.\nSecond, changes in monetary policy could conceivably affect the size and frequency of shocks hitting\nthe economy, at least as an econometrician would measure those shocks. This assertion seems odd\nat first, as we are used to thinking of shocks as exogenous events, arising from \"outside the model,\" so\nto speak. However, econometricians typically do not measure shocks directly but instead infer them\nfrom movements in macroeconomic variables that they cannot otherwise explain. Shocks in this sense\nmay certainly reflect the monetary regime. For example, consider the cost-push shocks that played\nsuch an important role in 1970s' thinking about inflation. Seemingly unexplained or autonomous\nmovements in wages and prices during this period, which analysts would have interpreted as shocks\nto wage and price equations, may in fact have been the result of earlier monetary policy actions, or\n(more subtly) of monetary policy actions expected by wage- and price-setters to take place in the\nfuture. In an influential paper, Robert Barsky and Lutz Kilian (2001) analyze the oil price shocks of the\n1970s in this spirit. Barsky and Kilian provide evidence that the extraordinary increases in nominal oil\nprices during the 1970s were made feasible primarily by earlier expansionary monetary policies rather\nthan by truly exogenous political or economic events.\nThird, monetary policy can also affect the distribution of measured shocks by changing the sensitivity\nof pricing and other economic decisions to exogenous outside events. For example, significant\nmovements in the price of oil and other commodities continued to occur after 1984. However, in a\nlow-inflation environment, with stable inflation expectations and a general perception that firms do not\nhave pricing power, commodity price shocks are not passed into final goods prices to nearly the same\ndegree as in a looser monetary environment. As a result, a change in commodity prices of a given size\nshows up as a smaller shock to output and consumer prices today than it would have in the earlier\nperiod. Likewise, there is evidence that fluctuations in exchange rates have smaller effects on\ndomestic prices and economic activity when inflation is less volatile and inflation expectations are\nstabilized (Gagnon and Ihrig, 2002; Devereux, Engel, and Storgaard, 2003).\nFourth, changes in inflation expectations, which are ultimately the product of the monetary policy\nregime, can also be confused with truly exogenous shocks in conventional econometric analyses.\nMarvin Goodfriend (1993) has suggested, for example, that insufficiently anchored inflation\nexpectations have led to periodic \"inflation scares\", in which inflation expectations have risen in an\napparently autonomous manner. Increases in inflation expectations have the flavor of adverse\naggregate supply shocks in that they tend to increase the volatility of both inflation and output, in a\ncombination that depends on how strongly the monetary policymakers act to offset these changes in\nexpectations.\nTheoretical and empirical support for the idea that inflation expectations may become an independent\nsource of instability has grown in recent years.12 As I mentioned earlier, a number of researchers have\nfound that the reaction of monetary policymakers to inflation has strengthened, in that the estimated\ncoefficient on inflation in the Taylor rule has risen from something less than 1 before 1979 to a value\nsignificantly greater than 1 in the more recent period. If the policy interest rate responds to increases in\ninflation by less than one-for-one (so that the real policy rate does not rise in the face of higher\ninflation), economic theory tells us that inflation expectations and the economy in general can become\nunstable. The problem arises from the fact that, if policymakers do not react sufficiently aggressively to\nincreases in inflation, spontaneously arising expectations of increased inflation can ultimately be\nselfconfirming and even self-reinforcing. Incidentally, the stability requirement that the policy rate respond\nto inflation by more than one-for-one is called the Taylor principle (Taylor, 1993, 1999) - the third\nconcept named after John Taylor that has played a role in this talk. The finding that monetary\npolicymakers violated the Taylor principle during the 1970s but satisfied the principle in the past two\ndecades would be consistent with a reduced incidence of destabilizing expectational shocks.13\nSupport for the view that inflation expectations can be an independent source of economic volatility\nhas also emerged from the extensive recent literature on learning and macroeconomics (Evans and\nHonkopohja, 2001). For example, Athanasios Orphanides and John C. Williams (2003a, 2003b) have\nstudied models in which the public must learn the central bank's underlying preferences regarding\ninflation by observing the actual inflation process.14 With learning, inflation expectations take on a\nmore adaptive character; in particular, high and unstable inflation will beget similar characteristics in\nthe pattern of inflation expectations. As Orphanides and Williams show, when inflation expectations\nare poorly anchored, so that the public is highly uncertain about the long-run rate of inflation that the\ncentral bank hopes to achieve, they can become an additional source of volatility in the economy. An\nanalysis that did not properly control for the expectational effects of changes in monetary policy might\nincorrectly conclude that the Taylor curve had shifted in an adverse direction.\nConclusion\nThe Great Moderation, the substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility over the past twenty years,\nis a striking economic development. Whether the dominant cause of the Great Moderation is structural\nchange, improved monetary policy, or simply good luck is an important question about which no\nconsensus has yet formed. I have argued today that improved monetary policy has likely made an\nimportant contribution not only to the reduced volatility of inflation (which is not particularly\ncontroversial) but to the reduced volatility of output as well. Moreover, because a change in the\nmonetary policy regime has pervasive effects, I have suggested that some of the effects of improved\nmonetary policies may have been misidentified as exogenous changes in economic structure or in the\ndistribution of economic shocks. This conclusion on my part makes me optimistic for the future,\nbecause I am confident that monetary policymakers will not forget the lessons of the 1970s.\nI have put my case for better monetary policy rather forcefully today, because I think it likely that the\npolicy explanation for the Great Moderation deserves more credit than it has received in the literature.\nHowever, let me close by emphasizing that the debate remains very much open. Although I have\nfocused on its strengths, the monetary policy hypothesis has potential deficiencies as well. For\nexample, although I pointed out the difficulty that the structural change and good-luck explanations\nhave in accounting for the rather sharp decline in volatility after 1984, one might also question whether\nthe change in monetary policy regime was sufficiently sharp to have had the effects I have attributed to\nit.15 The consistency of the monetary policy explanation with the experience of the 1950s, a period of\nstable inflation during which output volatility declined but was high in absolute terms, deserves further\ninvestigation. Moreover, several of the channels by which monetary policy may have affected volatility\nthat I have mentioned today remain largely theoretical possibilities and have not received much in the\nway of rigorous empirical testing. One of my goals today was to stimulate further research on this\nquestion. Clearly, the sources of the Great Moderation will continue to be an area for fruitful analysis\nand debate.\nFigure 1\nMonetary policy and the variability of output and inflation",

         "Alan Greenspan: The critical role of education in the nation's economy\nRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce 2004 Annual Meeting, Omaha,\n20 February 2004.\n* * *\nThe United States economy has long been characterized by a strong tradition of entrepreneurial spirit\namong our business people, a high level of skill among our workers, and an openness by firms and\nworkers alike to intense competition within and beyond our borders. Those attributes have given us a\nstandard of living unparalleled for so large a population - and one that has risen steadily over the\nhistory of our nation.\nBut with that bounty has also come the inevitable stresses and anxieties that accompany economic\nadvance. One concern that has persisted for some time is the fear that we are irreversibly losing\nmanufacturing jobs because of businesses' efforts to extract rapid gains in production efficiencies and\nto cut labor costs by tapping the lower-wage economies of Asia and Latin America.\nMore recently, similar concerns have arisen about the possibility that an increasing number of our\nbetter-paying white-collar jobs will be lost to outsourcing, especially to India and China. Many of these\njobs are in the service sector, and they were previously perceived as secure and largely free from the\ninternational competition long faced in the manufacturing sector. There is a palpable unease that\nbusinesses and jobs are being drained from the United States, with potentially adverse long-run\nimplications for unemployment and the standard of living of the average American.\nThe issue is both important and sensitive, dealing as it does with the longer-term wealth of our nation\nand with the immediate welfare of so many individuals and communities. In the debate that has\nensued, a large gulf is often perceived between the arguments of economists, who almost always\npoint to the considerable benefits offered over the long term by exposure to free and open trade, and\nthe obvious stress felt by those caught on the downside of turbulence created by that exposure. It is\ncrucial that this gulf be bridged.\nAs history clearly shows, our economy is best served by full and vigorous engagement in the global\neconomy. Consequently, we need to increase our efforts to ensure that as many of our citizens as\npossible have the opportunity to capture the benefits that flow from that engagement. For reasons that\nI shall elucidate shortly, one critical element in creating those opportunities is to provide rigorous\neducation and ongoing training to all members of our society. This proposal is not novel; it is, in fact,\nthe strategy that we have followed successfully for most of the past century and a strategy that we\nnow should embrace with renewed commitment.\nOver the long sweep of American generations and waves of economic change, we simply have not\nexperienced a net drain of jobs to advancing technology or to other nations. Since the end of World\nWar II, the unemployment rate in the United States has averaged less than 6 percent with no apparent\ntrend; and as recently as 2000, it dipped below 4 percent.\nMoreover, real earnings of the average worker have continued to rise. Over the past century, per\ncapita real income has risen at an average rate of more than 2 percent per year, declining notably only\nduring the Great Depression of the 1930s and immediately following World War II. Incomes trended\nhigher whether we had a trade deficit or a trade surplus and whether international outsourcing was\nlarge or small.\nThe reason for this positive long-run trend in living standards appears to be that more fundamental\neconomic forces are determining real incomes, irrespective of the specific jobs in which they are\nearned and irrespective of the proportion of domestic consumption met by imports.\nIntensive research in recent years into the sources of economic growth among both developing and\ndeveloped nations generally point to a number of important factors: the state of knowledge and skill of\na population; the degree of control over indigenous natural resources; the quality of a country's legal\nsystem, particularly a strong commitment to a rule of law and protection of property rights; and yes, the\nextent of a country's openness to trade with the rest of the world.\nFor the United States, arguably the most important factor is the type of rule of law under which\neconomic activity takes place. When asked abroad why the United States has become the most\nprosperous large economy in the world, I respond, with only mild exaggeration, that our forefathers\nwrote a constitution and set in motion a system of laws that protects individual rights, especially the\nright to own property. Nonetheless, the degree of state protection is sometimes in dispute. But by and\nlarge, secure property rights are almost universally accepted by Americans as a critical pillar of our\neconomy.\nWhile the right of property in the abstract is generally uncontested in all societies embracing\ndemocratic market capitalism, different degrees of property protection do apparently foster different\neconomic incentives and outcomes. Someone who owns a piece of land, but is restricted to a specific\nuse, does not have unequivocal ownership and will act accordingly. Indeed, economic regulation, by\nits nature, impinges on the exercise of a property right. Continuous changes in regulations and, hence,\nin the consistency of property protection create a less certain environment, which undermines\nincentives to long-term investment and prevents the most productive use of our resources. The high\nlevel of protection for property rights and, for the most part, our reliance on regulation that is\nmarketsensitive are significant factors in the overall attractiveness both to Americans and to foreigners of\ninvesting in the United States.\nThe second critical aspect of wealth creation in the United States, and doubtless globally, is the level\nof knowledge and skill of the population. Today, the knowledge required to run the economy, which is\nfar more complex than in our past, is both deeper and broader than ever before. We need to ensure\nthat education in the United States, formal or otherwise, is supplying skills adequate for the effective\nfunctioning of our economy. The recent exceptional trends in U.S. productivity suggest that we are\ncoping, but this observation should not lead to complacency.\n* * *\nProductivity in the United States has increased generation after generation, creating ever-rising\nstandards of living. This trend has persisted whether our competitive advantage came from the\ndevelopment of more efficient technologies in agriculture, textiles, and steel, or, more recently, from\nthe design and fabrication of microprocessors and the harnessing of the human genome. Our\nknowledge-based skills in a business environment, supported by a rule of law, have enabled our\nworkforce to create ever-greater value added - irrespective of what goods and services we have\nchosen to produce at home and what and how much we have chosen to import.\nOnly when property rights are adequately protected will the entrepreneurs willingly work a heroic\neighteen hours a day in their garages or at their computer terminals, secure in the knowledge that they\nwill own what they create. In addition, those workers who are fortunate to work in a nation that protects\nthe property rights of investors, both foreign and domestic, will benefit from the low cost of capital\nassociated with secure property rights. That protection has fostered a thriving venture capital industry\nto finance the nascent ideas of budding entrepreneurs and has motivated existing businesses to invest\nsome of their profits in research development.\nThe real income earned by a worker depends importantly on his or her intelligence and skill. The\ncapacity of workers, after being displaced, to find a new job that will eventually provide nearly\ncomparable pay most often depends on the general knowledge of the worker and the ability of that\nindividual to learn new skills. Even in the best of circumstances, discharged workers experience some\nloss of income in a transition to a new job and the associated new skills. Indeed, finding a new job\ntakes time, and typically results in at least a temporary drop in pay. That loss, especially in a soft labor\nmarket, is not only a short-term drag on aggregate incomes but also a source of stress on the affected\nindividuals.\nGeneric capabilities in mathematics, writing, and verbal skills are key to the ability to learn and to apply\nnew skills and thus to earn higher real wages over time. The avenues to acquiring those skills are\nmany, and one effective tool that we have developed to facilitate the transition to a new job or\nprofession has been our community colleges. These two-year institutions have been in the forefront of\nteaching the types of skills that build on workers' previous experiences to create new job skills.\nCurrently almost one in three of their enrollees are aged thirty or older, a statistic that suggests that\nthese individuals have previous job experience. The impressive expansion of these learning centers\nattests to their success in imparting both general and practical job-related learning. A rising proportion\nof the population is also taking advantage of both general adult education and work-related instruction.\nThe fact that, over the years, more than 94 percent of the workforce has been employed, on average,\nindicates that U.S. workers apparently have been sufficiently skilled and motivated to learn the new\ntasks that enable them to earn, on average, an ever-rising real wage.\nThe never-ending necessity to learn new skills is due to the gradually but inexorably changing nature\nof our economy. The innovations that have so accelerated productivity in recent years are an\nextension of a longer-term, ever-growing conceptualization of economic output. The value added to\nour GDP from physical material input and manual labor has grown very slowly over the decades.1 By\nfar, the greatest contribution during the past half century to our average annual real GDP increase of\n3-1/4 percent has been the ideas embodied in both our human and physical capital. Technological\nadvance is continually altering the shape, nature, and complexity of our economic processes.\nThis rising complexity has required the labor force to be more and more technically oriented. Years of\nschooling, a rough proxy for skills, averaged nine and one-quarter years in 1950. A half century later\nschooling averaged more than twelve years. But technology and, more recently, competition from\nabroad have risen to a point at which demand for the lowest skilled workers in developed countries is\ndiminishing, placing pressure on their wages. These workers will need to be equipped with the skills to\ncompete effectively for the new jobs that our economy will create.\nBut where will these jobs come from? For generations, human ingenuity has been creating products,\nindustries, and jobs that never before existed, from vehicle assembling to computer software\nengineering, and with them have come new opportunities for workers with the necessary skills. Judged\nby rates of return and productivity gains, our workforce has appeared sufficiently skilled, through these\ngenerations to manage our increasingly complex capital stock.\nBut in the past two decades, our system has had obvious strains, apparently reflecting an inability of\nour workforce to fully meet the ever-increasing skill requirements of an economy whose GDP is\nbecoming more conceptual.\nAt the risk of some oversimplification, if the skill composition of our workforce meshed fully with the\nneeds of our increasingly complex capital stock, wage-skill differentials would be stable, and\npercentage changes in wage rates would be the same for all job grades. But for the past twenty years\nthe real incomes of skilled, especially highly skilled, workers have risen more than the average of all\nworkers, whereas real wage rate increases for lesser-skilled workers were below average, indeed flat.\nThis situation suggests that, broadly speaking, we have been facing a shortage of highly skilled\nworkers and a surplus of lesser-skilled workers relative to the optimum needs of our capital stock.\nThrough the 1960s, the addition of skilled college graduates to the labor force, in part the result of\nschooling financed by the GI Bill, was sufficient to hold wage increases among the highly skilled to\naverage gains. Real wages of the lesser skilled also rose significantly, in part, the result of effective\nhigh-school educations and the many skills learned during the war.\nAlthough in recent years the proportion of our labor force made up of those with at least some college\nhas continued to grow, we appear, nonetheless, to be graduating too few skilled workers to address\nthe apparent imbalance between the supply of such workers and the burgeoning demand for them.\nPerhaps the accelerated pace of high-tech equipment installations associated with the large increases\nin productivity growth in recent years is placing unachievable demands for skilled graduates over the\nshort run. If the apparent acceleration in the demand for skilled workers to staff our high-tech capital\nstock is temporary as many presume, the pressure on our schools would ease as would the upward\npressure on high-skilled wages.\nMore broadly, in considering the issue of expanding our skilled workforce, many have a gnawing\nsense that our problems may be more than temporary and that the roots of the problem may extend\nback through our education system. Many of our students languish at too low a level of skill, and the\nresult is an apparent excess of supply relative to a declining demand. These changing balances are\nmost evident in the failure of real wages at the lower end of our income distribution to rise during the\npast quarter century.\nThe hypothesis that we should be able to advance the knowledge that our students acquire as they\nmove from kindergarten to twelfth grade, gets some support from international comparisons. A study\nconducted in 1995 revealed that, although our fourth-grade students were above average in both math\nand science, by the time they reached the eighth grade, they had dropped closer to the average.2 By\nthe time they were in their last year of high school, they had fallen well below the international\naverage. Accordingly, we apparently have quite a distance to go before we catch up.\nIn short, our secondary school system needs to serve the requirements of a changing economy in the\nsame way that the expansion of high schools with a broad curriculum served us so well in the first half\nof the twentieth century. Early last century, technological advance required workers with a higher level\nof cognitive skills - for instance the ability to read manuals, to interpret blueprints, or to understand\nformulas.\nOur educational system responded: In the 1920s and 1930s, high school enrollment in this country\nexpanded rapidly, pulling youth from rural areas, where opportunities were limited, into\nmoreproductive occupations in business and broadening the skills of students to meet the needs of an\nadvancing manufacturing sector. It became the job of these institutions to prepare students for work\nlife. In the context of the demands of the economy at that time, a high-school diploma represented the\ntraining needed to be successful in most aspects of American enterprise. The economic returns for\nhaving a high-school diploma rose and, as a result, high-school enrollment rates climbed.\nBy the time that the United States entered World War II, the median seventeen-year-old was a\nhighschool graduate - an accomplishment that set us apart from other countries. I cannot dismiss the\nnotion that we can learn something from that period and perhaps from other countries. Still, I realize\nthat the world was different from today in many ways. Societal changes have been numerous and\nprofound, and our schools are being asked to do a great deal more than they have in the past. We\nneed to be forward looking in order to adapt our educational system to the evolving needs of the\neconomy and the realities of our changing society. Those efforts will require the collaboration of\npolicymakers, education experts, and - importantly - our citizens. It is an effort that should not be\npostponed.\n* * *\nWe have seen encouraging signs of late that the labor market is improving. In all likelihood,\nemployment will begin to increase more quickly before long as output continues to expand. But fears\nabout job security are understandably significant when nearly two million of our workforce have been\nunemployed for more than a year. We have reason to be confident that new jobs will displace old ones\nas they always have, but America's job-turnover process is never without pain for those caught in the\njob-losing portion.\nThose who have lost jobs, I know, are not readily consoled by the fact that current job insecurity\nconcerns are not new. But keeping the current period in context is instructive. Jobs in the United\nStates were perceived as migrating to low-wage Japan in the 1950s and 1960s, to low-wage Mexico in\nthe 1990s, and most recently to low-wage China. Japan, of course, is no longer characterized by a\nlow-wage workforce, and many in Mexico are now complaining of job losses to low-wage China.\nTo be sure, many of our fellow citizens have experienced real hardships in our economic environment,\nwhich is becoming ever more internationally competitive. But the protectionist cures being advanced to\naddress these hardships will make matters worse rather than better.\nThe loss of jobs over the past three years is attributable largely to rapid declines in the demand for\nindustrial goods and to outsized gains in productivity that have caused effective supply to outstrip\ndemand. Protectionism will do little to create jobs; and if foreigners retaliate, we will surely lose jobs.\nWe need instead to discover the means to enhance the skills of our workforce and to further open\nmarkets here and abroad to allow our workers to compete effectively in the global marketplace.\nIn closing, I have stressed the importance of redressing the apparent imbalances between the supply\nand demand for labor across the spectrum of skills. Those imbalances have the potential to hamper\nthe adjustment flexibility of our economy overall. But these growing imbalances are also aggravating\nthe inequality of incomes in this country. The single central action necessary to ameliorate these\nimbalances and their accompanying consequences for income inequality is to boost the skills, and\nthus earning potential, of those workers lower on the skill ladder.\nTo be sure, Americans have not been obsessed with the distribution of income but have instead\nplaced much greater emphasis on the need to provide equality of opportunity. But equal opportunity\nrequires equal access to knowledge. We cannot expect everyone to be equally skilled. But we need to\npursue equality of opportunity to ensure that our economic system works at maximum efficiency and is\nperceived as just in its distribution of rewards.",

         "Alan Greenspan: Understanding household debt obligations\nRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Credit Union National Association 2004 Governmental Affairs Conference, Washington\nDC, 23 February 2004.\n* * *\nIntroduction: credit unions and consumer lending\nCredit unions have long focused on the needs of their members. Traditionally, the industry has\nspecialized in personal and automobile loans, and the bulk of lending at many credit unions remains\nconcentrated on these types of loans. In the past decade, however, many of you have become more\ninvolved in first- and second-lien mortgage loans. With lending efforts focused on consumer and\nresidential mortgage loans, credit unions have a natural interest in the financial health of America's\nhouseholds.\nWe have a similar interest at the Federal Reserve. Consumer spending accounts for more than\ntwo-thirds of gross domestic product, and residential investment - the construction of new homes -\nmakes up another 4 percent or so of GDP. In addition, households own more than $14 trillion in real\nestate assets, almost twice the amount they own in mutual funds and directly hold in stocks. Over the\npast two years, significant increases in the value of real estate assets have, for some households,\nmitigated stock market losses and supported consumption.\nMeasuring the financial health of households\nOne concern of many lending institutions has been the increase in bankruptcy rates during the past\nseveral years to an unusually high level. Elevated bankruptcy rates are troubling because they\nhighlight the difficulties some households experience during economic slowdowns. But bankruptcy\nrates are not a reliable measure of the overall health of the household sector because they do not tend\nto forecast general economic conditions, and they can be significantly influenced over time by changes\nin laws and lender practices.\nIn contrast to bankruptcy rates, delinquency rates may be a bit better measure of the overall health of\nthe household sector. The recent experience with some delinquency rates has been encouraging, with\nrates falling for several measures of credit card and automobile debt. But, like bankruptcy rates,\ndelinquency rates can reflect changes in underwriting and collection practices, and they may measure\nthe financial health of a relatively narrow set of households.\nA primary measure used by the Federal Reserve to assess the extent of American household\nindebtedness and to provide a view of the financial health of the overall consumer sector is the\nquarterly debt service ratio. The debt service ratio measures the share of income committed by\nhouseholds for paying interest and principal on their debt. When the debt service ratio is high,\nhouseholds have less money available to purchase goods or services. In addition, households with a\nhigh debt service ratio are more likely to default on their obligations when they suffer adversity, such\nas job loss or illness.\nOf course, debt payments are not the only financial obligations of households and thus the Federal\nReserve also calculates a more general financial obligations ratio. This measure incorporates\nhouseholds' other recurring expenses, such as rents, auto leases, homeowners' insurance and\nproperty taxes, that might be subtracting from the uncommitted income available to households. The\nFederal Reserve splits the aggregate financial obligations ratio into separate measures for\nhomeowners and renters, measures that I will discuss in detail below.\nChanges in the debt service and financial obligation ratios over time\nBoth the debt service ratio and the financial obligations ratio rose modestly over the 1990s. During the\npast two years, however, both ratios have been essentially flat. The debt service ratio has remained a\ntouch above 13 percent, whereas the financial obligations ratio has hovered a bit above 18 percent.\nThese ratios move slowly because both the stock of debt and the interest rates associated with the\nstock change slowly. Another reason is the stability in the ratio for homeowners, who hold the bulk of\nall household debt. Despite annual mortgage debt growth that exceeded 12 percent a year over the\npast two years, the financial obligations of homeowners have stayed about constant because\nmortgage rates have remained at historically low levels. The homeowners' financial obligations ratio\nhas also remained relatively constant despite this very rapid growth in mortgage debt, partly as a\nresult of an enormous wave of refinancing of existing mortgages, which ended only in the fall of 2003.\nRefinancing has allowed homeowners both to take advantage of lower rates to reduce their monthly\npayments and, in many cases, to extract some of the built-up equity in their homes. These two effects\nseem to have roughly offset each other, suggesting that homeowners might set a target for their\nmortgage payments as a proportion of income and adjust their borrowing accordingly.\nIndeed, the surge in mortgage refinancings likely improved rather than worsened the financial\ncondition of the average homeowner. Some of the equity extracted through mortgage refinancing was\nused to pay down more expensive, non-tax-deductible consumer debt or used to make purchases that\nwould otherwise have been financed by more expensive and less tax-favored credit. Indeed, the\nrefinancing phenomenon has very likely been a supportive factor for the general economy. The\nprecise effect is difficult to identify because it is hard to know how much of the spending financed by\nhome equity extraction might have taken place anyway. Nonetheless, we know that increases in home\nvalues and the borrowing against home equity likely helped cushion the effects of a declining stock\nmarket during 2001 and 2002.\nRising credit card debts for homeowners and renters\nThe rise in homeowners' debt service burdens over the 1990s, albeit small, is associated with\nincreases in their nonmortgage debt and, in particular, with rising levels of credit card debt. The\nfinancial obligation associated with credit card debt is difficult to measure. On the one hand,\nhouseholds are obligated to pay only a minimum amount and thus, in times of financial stress, a\nhousehold can forgo making more than this minimum payment. On the other hand, we know that many\nhouseholds make more than the minimum payment and indeed likely would be quite uncomfortable\npaying only the minimum amount. During financial difficulties, these households might even consume\nless to pay more than the minimum. Defining the point at which households feel they should pay down\ntheir credit card debt is difficult, and thus our measure of debt service relies on estimates of minimum\npayments required by credit card lenders.\nThere are several reasons that homeowners might carry more credit card debt than they did a decade\nago, but these reasons generally do not indicate financial weakness among homeowning households.\nIndeed, as noted, delinquency rates on credit card payments have been falling during the past year,\ndespite households' relatively larger holding of credit card debt.\nOne possible reason for the secular increase in credit card debt is rising U.S. homeownership rates.\nAccording to the Bureau of the Census, the share of U.S. households that own homes rose from about\n64 percent in 1990 to almost 68 percent in 2003 even as the population grew substantially. Because of\nrising incomes, lower interest rates, and increased rates of household formation, more people have\nchosen to buy homes rather than to rent, increasing the value of mortgages outstanding. Although it\ndoes not show the relationship conclusively, the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances\nsuggests that these newer homeowners who make smaller down payments tend to bring with them\nhigher levels of nonmortgage debt and, in particular, credit card debt. The ability of lending institutions\nto manage the risks associated with mortgages that have high loan-to-value ratios seems to have\nimproved markedly over the past decade, and thus the movement of renters into homeownership is\ngenerally to be applauded, even if it causes our measures of debt service of homeowners to rise\nsomewhat.\nAnother possible reason for rising credit card debt ratios is the use of credit cards for a variety of new\npurposes. The rise in credit card debt in the latter half of the 1990s is mirrored by a fall in unsecured\npersonal loans. Reflecting this general trend, the proportion of personal loans in credit union portfolios\nhas been declining as well. The wider availability of credit cards and their ease of use have\nencouraged this substitution. The convenience of credit cards also has caused homeowners to shift\nthe payment for a variety of expenditures to credit cards. In sum, credit card debt service ratios have\nrisen to some extent because households prefer credit cards as a method of payment.\n* * *\nIn contrast to the increase for homeowners, the rise in debt service ratios was steep for renters in the\nlatter half of the 1990s. The rise for renters, as for homeowners, is concentrated in credit card lending\nand thus may reflect some of the same factors that have influenced homeowner debt service ratios.\nBut unlike homeowners, renters in recent years have been using a higher fraction of their incomes for\npayments on student loans and used-car debt. Renters tend to be younger and have lower incomes\nthan homeowners, so the fact that student loans and used-car payments are a larger share of their\nincome is not surprising, although this trend might be worrisome if it indicates greater difficulties in\nbecoming financially established.\nIn addition, some of the rise in the debt service ratios of renters, unlike that of homeowners, occurred\nduring the most recent recession, a difference highlighting the fact that incomes of renters are\ngenerally more at risk during economic downturns. Renters' debt service ratios have stabilized during\nthe past two years, a hopeful sign that is likely correlated with the overall improvement in the\neconomy. However, the rise in the renter debt service ratio might indicate some trends among these\nhouseholds that may be of concern and that need to be investigated further.\nMitigating homeowner payment shocks\nRising debt service ratios are a concern if they reflect household financial stress and presage a drop in\nconsumption or a rise in losses by lenders. Most homeowners and renters are aware of the possible\ndifficulties should they lock themselves into a high level of debt payment obligations. Financial\ninstitutions might be able to help some households in this regard by looking for ways that households -\nboth renters and homeowners - can shield themselves from unexpected payment shocks.\nOne way homeowners attempt to manage their payment risk is to use fixed-rate mortgages, which\ntypically allow homeowners to prepay their debt when interest rates fall but do not involve an increase\nin payments when interest rates rise. Homeowners pay a lot of money for the right to refinance and for\nthe insurance against increasing mortgage payments. Calculations by market analysts of the \"option\nadjusted spread\" on mortgages suggest that the cost of these benefits conferred by fixed-rate\nmortgages can range from 0.5 percent to 1.2 percent, raising homeowners' annual after-tax mortgage\npayments by several thousand dollars. Indeed, recent research within the Federal Reserve suggests\nthat many homeowners might have saved tens of thousands of dollars had they held adjustable-rate\nmortgages rather than fixed-rate mortgages during the past decade, though this would not have been\nthe case, of course, had interest rates trended sharply upward.\nAmerican homeowners clearly like the certainty of fixed mortgage payments. This preference is in\nstriking contrast to the situation in some other countries, where adjustable-rate mortgages are far more\ncommon and where efforts to introduce American-type fixed-rate mortgages generally have not been\nsuccessful. Fixed-rate mortgages seem unduly expensive to households in other countries. One\npossible reason is that these mortgages effectively charge homeowners high fees for protection\nagainst rising interest rates and for the right to refinance.\nAmerican consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the\ntraditional fixed-rate mortgage. To the degree that households are driven by fears of payment shocks\nbut are willing to manage their own interest rate risks, the traditional fixed-rate mortgage may be an\nexpensive method of financing a home.\nConclusion\nIn evaluating household debt burdens, one must remember that debt-to-income ratios have been\nrising for at least a half century. With household assets rising as well, the ratio of net worth to income\nis currently somewhat higher than its long-run average. So long as financial intermediation continues\nto expand, both household debt and assets are likely to rise faster than income. Without an\nexamination of what is happening to both assets and liabilities, it is difficult to ascertain the true burden\nof debt service. Overall, the household sector seems to be in good shape, and much of the apparent\nincrease in the household sector's debt ratios over the past decade reflects factors that do not suggest\nincreasing household financial stress. And, in fact, during the past two years, debt service ratios have\nbeen stable.",

         "Alan Greenspan: Government-sponsored enterprises\nTestimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate,\n24 February 2004.\n* * *\nMr. Chairman, Senator Sarbanes, and Members of the Committee: Thank you for inviting me to\ndiscuss the role of housing-related government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in our economy. These\nGSEs - the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage\nCorporation (Freddie Mac), and the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) - collectively dominate the\nfinancing of residential housing in the United States. Indeed, these entities have grown to be among\nthe largest financial institutions in the United States, and they now stand behind more than $4 trillion of\nmortgages - or more than three-quarters of the single-family mortgages in the United States - either by\nholding the mortgage-related assets directly or assuming their credit risk.1 Given their ties to the\ngovernment and the consequent private market subsidized debt that they issue, it is little wonder that\nthese GSEs have come under increased scrutiny as their competitive presence in the marketplace has\nincreased.\nIn my remarks, I will not focus on the Federal Home Loan Banks, although much of this analysis\napplies to them as well. In fact, because the Home Loan Banks can design their advances to\nencompass almost any type of risk, they are more complex to analyze than other GSEs and, hence,\nraise additional issues.\n* * *\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (hereafter Fannie and Freddie)\ncontributed importantly to the development of the secondary mortgage markets for home loans and to\nthe diversification of funding sources for depository institutions and other mortgage originators.\nAlthough the risk that a home mortgage borrower may default is small for any individual mortgage,\nrisks can be substantial for a financial institution holding a large volume of mortgages for homes\nconcentrated in one area or a few areas of the country. The possible consequences of such\nconcentration of risk were vividly illustrated by the events of the 1980s, when oil prices fell and the\nsubsequent economic distress led to numerous mortgage defaults in Texas and surrounding states.\nThe secondary markets pioneered by Fannie and Freddie permit mortgage lenders to diversify these\nrisks geographically and thus to extend more safely a greater amount of residential mortgage credit\nthan might otherwise be prudent.\nThe key to developing secondary markets was securitization, and Fannie and Freddie played a critical\nrole in developing and promoting mortgage securitization, the process whereby mortgages are\nbundled together into pools and then turned into securities that can be bought and sold alongside\nother debt securities. Securitization by Fannie and Freddie allows mortgage originators to separate\nthemselves from almost all aspects of risk associated with mortgage lending: Once the originator sells\n1\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac stand behind mortgages in two ways: The first method is to purchase mortgages, bundle them\ntogether, and then sell claims on the cash flows to be generated by these bundles. These claims are known as\nmortgagebacked securities (MBS). The second method involves Fannie's and Freddie's purchasing mortgages or their own\nmortgage-backed securities outright and financing those purchases by selling debt directly in the name of the GSE. Both\nmethods create publicly traded securities and thus permit a wide variety and large number of purely private investors to fund\nmortgages. Using the first method, Fannie and Freddie are relieved of interest-rate risk but are still exposed to credit risk\nbecause they guarantee MBS investors against the risk that some homeowners will default on the underlying mortgages.\nThe second method of funding mortgages increases Fannie's and Freddie's debt outstanding and expands their balance\nsheets. In this case, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must manage the interest rate, prepayment, and credit risks associated\nwith the mortgages they purchase.\nIn the conforming mortgage market, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, using these two methods, play dominant roles in funding\nand managing the credit risk of the mortgages, but they do not participate directly in the origination of mortgage credit.\nDepository institutions, mortgage bankers, and their affiliates originate most mortgages. However, the underwriting\nstandards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac substantially influence which borrowers receive mortgage credit. As discussed\nbelow, because of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's government-sponsored advantages, there currently is no secondary\nmarket for conforming mortgages other than that provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. If a bank chooses not to sell the\nmortgage that it originates, it must fund that mortgage and manage the associated credit and interest rate risks itself.\nBIS Review 12/2004\nthe loan into the secondary market, he or she may play no further role in the contract. This\ndevelopment was particularly important before the emergence of truly nationwide banking institutions\nbecause it provided a dramatically improved method for diversifying mortgage credit risk. Fannie and\nFreddie demonstrated that, by facilitating the diversification of mortgage portfolios and insisting on the\napplication of sound loan underwriting standards, the credit risk associated with holding conforming\nmortgages could be reduced to very low levels and could be distributed across a wide variety and\nlarge number of investors. This innovation in the mortgage market led to the securitization of many\nother assets and to the creation of many other types of securities. During the 1980s, the GSEs led the\nprivate sector in this innovation, and their contribution enhanced the stability of our financial markets.\nMortgage securitization continues to perform this crucial function, and its techniques have now been\napplied by the private sector in many markets, including markets for automobile loans, credit card\nloans, nonconforming mortgages, and commercial mortgages. Asset-backed securities and the\nsecondary markets in which they trade generally provide both households and businesses with\nexcellent access to credit at an appropriate risk-adjusted interest rate. Moreover, credit supply is far\nmore stable today than it was because it is now founded on a much broader base of potential sources\nof funds. The aspiring homeowner no longer depends on the willingness of the local commercial bank\nor savings and loan association to hold his or her mortgage. Similarly, the sources of credit available\nto purchasers of cars and users of credit cards have expanded widely beyond local credit institutions.\nUnbeknownst to such borrowers, their loans may ultimately be held by a pension fund, an insurance\ncompany, a university endowment, or another investor far removed from the local area. This\ndevelopment has facilitated the substantial growth of nonmortgage consumer credit. Indeed, in the\nUnited States, more than $2 trillion of securitized assets currently exists with no government\nguarantee, either explicit or implicit.\n* * *\nGiven their history of innovation in mortgage-backed securities, why do Fannie and Freddie now\ngenerate such substantial concern? The unease relates mainly to the scale and growth of the\nmortgage-related asset portfolios held on their balance sheets. That growth has been facilitated, as\nleast in part, by a perceived special advantage of these institutions that keeps normal market restraints\nfrom being fully effective.\nThe GSEs' special advantage arises because, despite the explicit statement on the prospectus to GSE\ndebentures that they are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, most investors\nhave apparently concluded that during a crisis the federal government will prevent the GSEs from\ndefaulting on their debt. An implicit guarantee is thus created not by the Congress but by the\nwillingness of investors to accept a lower rate of interest on GSE debt than they would otherwise\nrequire in the absence of federal sponsorship.\nBecause Fannie and Freddie can borrow at a subsidized rate, they have been able to pay higher\nprices to originators for their mortgages than can potential competitors and to gradually but inexorably\ntake over the market for conforming mortgages.2 This process has provided Fannie and Freddie with a\npowerful vehicle and incentive for achieving extremely rapid growth of their balance sheets. The\nresultant scale gives Fannie and Freddie additional advantages that potential private-sector\ncompetitors cannot overcome. Importantly, the scale itself has reinforced investors' perceptions that, in\nthe event of a crisis involving Fannie and Freddie, policymakers would have little alternative than to\nhave the taxpayers explicitly stand behind the GSE debt. This view is widespread in the marketplace\ndespite the privatization of Fannie and Freddie and their control by private shareholders, because\nthese institutions continue to have government missions, a line of credit with the Treasury, and other\ngovernment benefits, which confer upon them a special status in the eyes of many investors.\nThe part of Fannie's and Freddie's purchases from mortgage originators that they do not fund\nthemselves, but instead securitize, guarantee, and sell into the market, is a somewhat different\nbusiness. The value of the guarantee is a function of the expectation that Fannie and Freddie will not\nbe allowed to fail. While the rate of return reflects the implicit subsidy, a smaller amount of Fannie's\nand Freddie's overall profit comes from securitizing and selling mortgage-backed securities (MBS).\n* * *\nFannie's and Freddie's persistently higher rates of return for bearing the relatively low credit risks\nassociated with conforming mortgages is evidence of a significant implicit subsidy. A recent study by a\nFederal Reserve economist, Wayne Passmore, attempts to quantify the value of that implicit subsidy\nto the private shareholders of Fannie and Freddie. His research indicates that it may account for more\nthan half of the stock market capitalization of these institutions. The study also suggests that these\ninstitutions pass little of the benefit of their government-sponsored status to homeowners in the form of\nlower mortgage rates.\nPassmore's analysis suggests that Fannie and Freddie likely lower mortgage rates less than 16 basis\npoints, with a best estimate centering on about 7 basis points. If the estimated 7 basis points is\ncorrect, the associated present value of homeowner savings is only about half the after-tax subsidy\nthat shareholders of these GSEs are estimated to receive. Congressional Budget Office and other\nestimates differ, but they come to the essentially same conclusion: A substantial portion of these\nGSEs' implicit subsidy accrues to GSE shareholders in the form of increased dividends and stock\nmarket value. Fannie and Freddie, as you know, have disputed the conclusions of many of these\nstudies.\nAs noted by the General Accounting Office, the task of assessing the costs and benefits associated\nwith the GSEs is difficult. One possible way to advance the technical discussion would be for the\nCongress to request disinterested parties to convene groups of technical experts in an effort to better\nunderstand and measure these costs and benefits.\n* * *\nThe Federal Reserve is concerned about the growth and the scale of the GSEs' mortgage portfolios,\nwhich concentrate interest rate and prepayment risks at these two institutions. Unlike many\nwellcapitalized savings and loans and commercial banks, Fannie and Freddie have chosen not to manage\nthat risk by holding greater capital. Instead, they have chosen heightened leverage, which raises\ninterest rate risk but enables them to multiply the profitability of subsidized debt in direct proportion to\ntheir degree of leverage. Without the expectation of government support in a crisis, such leverage\nwould not be possible without a significantly higher cost of debt.\nInterest rate risk associated with fixed-rate mortgages, unless supported by substantial capital,\nhowever, can be of even greater concern than the credit risk. Interest rate volatility combined with the\nability of homeowners to prepay their mortgages without penalty means that the cash flows associated\nwith the holding of mortgage debt directly or through mortgage-backed securities are highly uncertain,\neven if the probability of default is low.\nIn general, interest rate risk is readily handled by adjusting maturities of assets and liabilities. But\nhedging prepayment risk is more complex. To manage this risk with little capital requires a\nconceptually sophisticated hedging framework. In essence, the current system depends on the risk\nmanagers at Fannie and Freddie to do everything just right, rather than depending on a market-based\nsystem supported by the risk assessments and management capabilities of many participants with\ndifferent views and different strategies for hedging risks. Our financial system would be more robust if\nwe relied on a market-based system that spreads interest rate risks, rather than on the current system,\nwhich concentrates such risk with the GSEs.\n* * *\nAs always, concerns about systemic risk are appropriately focused on large, highly leveraged financial\ninstitutions such as the GSEs that play substantial roles in the functioning of financial markets. I should\nemphasize that Fannie and Freddie, to date, appear to have managed these risks well and that we\nsee nothing on the immediate horizon that is likely to create a systemic problem. But to fend off\npossible future systemic difficulties, which we assess as likely if GSE expansion continues unabated,\npreventive actions are required sooner rather than later.\nAs a general matter, we rely in a market economy upon market discipline to constrain the leverage of\nfirms, including financial institutions. However, the existence, or even the perception, of government\nbacking undermines the effectiveness of market discipline. A market system relies on the vigilance of\nlenders and investors in market transactions to assure themselves of their counterparties' strength.\nHowever, many counterparties in GSE transactions, when assessing their risk, clearly rely instead on\nthe GSEs' perceived special relationship to the government. Thus, with housing-related GSEs,\nregulators cannot rely significantly on market discipline. Indeed, they must assess whether these\ninstitutions hold appropriate amounts of capital relative to the risks that they assume and the costs that\nthey might impose on others, including taxpayers, in the event of a financial-market meltdown. The\nissues are similar to those that arise in the context of commercial banking and deposit insurance -\nindeed, they are the reason that commercial banks are regulated and subject to stringent regulatory\ncapital standards.\nTraditionally, questions of capital adequacy for financial institutions have been evaluated with regard\nto credit and interest rate risks. However, in the case of the GSEs and other large regulated financial\ninstitutions with significant roles in market functioning, liquidity and operation risks also need to be\nconsidered. Determining the suitable amount of capital for Fannie and Freddie is a difficult and\ntechnical process, and in the Federal Reserve's judgment, a regulator should have a free hand in\ndetermining the minimum and risk-based capital standards for these institutions.\nThe size of Fannie and Freddie, the complexity of their financial operations, and the general\nindifference of many investors to the financial condition of the GSEs because of their perceived special\nrelationship to the government suggest that the GSE regulator must have authority similar to that of\nthe banking regulators. In addressing the role of a new GSE regulator, the Congress needs to clarify\nthe circumstances under which a GSE can become insolvent and, in particular, the resultant position -\nboth during and after insolvency - of the investors that hold GSE debt. This process must be clear\nbefore it is needed; otherwise, should these institutions experience significant financial difficulty, the\nhands of any regulator, and of public authorities generally, would be constrained by uncertainties\nabout the process. Left unresolved, such uncertainties would only heighten the prospect that a crisis\nwould result in an explicit guaranteeing of GSE debt.\n* * *\nWorld-class regulation, by itself, may not be sufficient and indeed, as suggested by Treasury\nSecretary Snow, may even worsen the situation if market participants infer from such regulation that\nthe government is all the more likely to back GSE debt. This is the heart of a dilemma in designing\nregulation for the GSEs. On the one hand, if the regulation of the GSEs is strengthened, the market\nmay view them even more as extensions of the government and view their debt as government debt.\nThe result, short of a marked increase in capital, would be to expand the implicit subsidy and allow the\nGSEs to play an even larger unconstrained role in the financial markets. On the other hand, if we fail\nto strengthen GSE regulation, the possibility of an actual crisis or insolvency is increased.\nSome observers have argued that Fannie and Freddie are simple institutions with a function that is\nclear to all. The evidence suggests that this is far from the case. The difficulties of creating transparent\naccounting standards to reflect the gains and losses associated with hedging mortgage-prepayment\nrisk highlight that the business of taking on interest rate and prepayment risk is far from simple and is\ndifficult to communicate to outside investors.\nMost of the concerns associated with systemic risks flow from the size of the balance sheets that\nthese GSEs maintain. One way the Congress could constrain the size of these balance sheets is to\nalter the composition of Fannie's and Freddie's mortgage financing by limiting the dollar amount of\ntheir debt relative to the dollar amount of mortgages securitized and held by other investors. Although\nit is difficult to know how best to set such a rule, this approach would continue to expand the depth\nand liquidity of mortgage markets through mortgage securitization but would remove most of the\npotential systemic risks associated with these GSEs. Ideally such a ratio would focus the business\noperations of Fannie and Freddie on the enhancement of secondary markets and not on the capture\nof the implicit subsidy.3\nLimiting the debt of Fannie and Freddie and expanding their role in mortgage securitization would be\nconsistent with the original congressional intent that these institutions provide stability in the market for\nresidential mortgages and provide liquidity for mortgage investors. Deep and liquid markets for\nmortgages are made using mortgage-backed securities that are held by non-GSE private investors.\nFannie's and Freddie's purchases of their own or each other's securities with their debt do not appear\nneeded to supply mortgage market liquidity or to enhance capital markets in the United States.\nThe expansion of homeownership is a widely supported goal in this country. A sense of ownership and\ncommitment to our communities imparts a degree of stability that is particularly valuable to society. But\nthere are many ways to enhance the attractiveness of homeownership at significantly less potential\ncost to taxpayers than through the opaque and circuitous GSE paradigm currently in place.\nEven with a constraint on debt issuance, Fannie and Freddie would remain among the largest financial\ninstitutions in the United States and would be able to grow with the size of the mortgage markets.\nThese are important organizations that, because of their implicit subsidy, are expanding at a pace\nbeyond that consistent with systematic safety. They have made, and should - with less reliance on\nsubsidies - continue to make, major contributions to the financial system of the United States.\n* * *\nIn sum, the Congress needs to create a GSE regulator with authority on a par with that of banking\nregulators, with a free hand to set appropriate capital standards, and with a clear process sanctioned\nby the Congress for placing a GSE in receivership. However, if the Congress takes only these actions,\nit runs the risk of solidifying investors' perceptions that the GSEs are instruments of the government\nand that their debt is equivalent to government debt. The GSEs will have increased incentives to\ncontinue to grow faster than the overall home mortgage market. Because they already purchase most\nconforming mortgages, they, like all effective profit-maximizing organizations, will be seeking new\navenues to expand the scope of their operations, assisted by a subsidy that their existing or potential\ncompetitors do not enjoy.\nThus, GSEs need to be limited in the issuance of GSE debt and in the purchase of assets, both\nmortgages and nonmortgages, that they hold. Fannie and Freddie should be encouraged to continue\nto expand mortgage securitization, keeping mortgage markets deep and liquid while limiting the size of\ntheir portfolios. This action will allow the mortgage markets to support homeownership and\nhomebuilding in a manner consistent with preserving the safe and sound financial markets of the\nUnited States.",

         "Alan Greenspan: Economic outlook and current fiscal issues\nTestimony by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem before the Committee on the Budget, US House of Representatives, 25 February 2004.\n* * *\nMr. Chairman and members of the committee, I am pleased to be here today and to offer my views on\nthe outlook for the economy and current fiscal issues. I want to emphasize that I speak for myself and\nnot necessarily for the Federal Reserve.\nAs you know, the U.S. economy appears to have made the transition from a period of subpar growth\nto one of more vigorous expansion. Real gross domestic product (GDP) rose briskly in the second half\nof last year, fueled by a sizable increase in household spending, a notable strengthening in business\ninvestment, and a sharp rebound in exports. Moreover, productivity surged, prices remained stable,\nand financial conditions improved further. Overall, the economy has lately made impressive gains in\noutput and real incomes, although progress in creating jobs has been limited.\nThe most recent indicators suggest that the economy is off to a strong start in 2004, and prospects for\nsustaining the expansion in the period ahead are good. The marked improvement in the financial\nsituations of many households and businesses in recent years should bolster aggregate demand. And\nwith short-term real interest rates close to zero, monetary policy remains highly accommodative. Also,\nthe impetus from fiscal policy appears likely to stay expansionary through this year. At the same time,\nincreases in efficiency and a significant level of underutilized resources should help keep a lid on\ninflation.\nThis favorable short-term outlook for the U.S. economy, however, is playing out against a backdrop of\ngrowing concern about the prospects for the federal budget. As you are well aware, after having run\nsurpluses for a brief period around the turn of the decade, the federal budget has reverted to deficit.\nThe unified deficit swelled to $375 billion in fiscal 2003 and appears to be continuing to widen in the\ncurrent fiscal year. According to the latest projections from the Administration and the Congressional\nBudget Office (CBO), if current policies remain in place, the budget will stay in deficit for some time.\nIn part, the recent deficits have resulted from the economic downturn in 2001 and the period of slow\ngrowth that followed, as well as the sharp declines in equity prices. The deficits also reflect a\nsignificant step-up in spending on defense and higher outlays for homeland security and many other\nnondefense discretionary programs. Tax reductions - some of which were intended specifically to\nprovide stimulus to the economy - also contributed to the deterioration of the fiscal balance.\nFor a time, the fiscal stimulus associated with the larger deficits was helpful in shoring up a weak\neconomy. During the next few years, these deficits will tend to narrow somewhat as the economic\nexpansion proceeds and rising incomes generate increases in revenues. Moreover, the current\nramp-up in defense spending will not continue indefinitely. Merely maintaining a given military\ncommitment, rather than adding to it, will remove an important factor driving the deficit higher. But the\nratio of federal debt held by the public to GDP has already stopped falling and has even edged up in\nthe past couple of years - implying a worsening of the starting point from which policymakers will have\nto address the adverse budgetary implications of an aging population and rising health care costs.\nFor about a decade, the rules laid out in the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, and the later\nmodifications and extensions of the act, provided a procedural framework that helped the Congress\nmake the difficult decisions that were required to forge a better fiscal balance. However, the brief\nemergence of surpluses eroded the will to adhere to those rules, and many of the provisions that\nhelped to restrain budgetary decisionmaking in the 1990s - in particular, the limits on discretionary\nspending and the PAYGO requirements - were violated more and more frequently and eventually\nallowed to expire. In recent years, budget debates have turned to choices offered by those advocating\ntax cuts and those advocating increased spending. To date, actions that would lower forthcoming\ndeficits have received only narrow support, and many analysts are becoming increasingly concerned\nthat, without a restoration of the budget enforcement mechanisms and the fundamental political will\nthey signal, the inbuilt political bias in favor of red ink will once again become entrenched.\nIn 2008 - just four years from now - the first cohort of the baby-boom generation will reach 62, the\nearliest age at which Social Security retirement benefits may be claimed and the age at which about\nhalf of prospective beneficiaries choose to retire; in 2011, these individuals will reach 65 and will thus\nbe eligible for Medicare. At that time, under the intermediate assumptions of the OASDI trustees, there\nwill still be more than three covered workers for each OASDI beneficiary; by 2025, this ratio is\nprojected to be down to 2-1/4. This dramatic demographic change is certain to place enormous\ndemands on our nation's resources - demands we almost surely will be unable to meet unless action\nis taken. For a variety of reasons, that action is better taken as soon as possible.\nThe budget scenarios considered by the CBO in its December assessment of the long-term budget\noutlook offer a vivid - and sobering - illustration of the challenges we face as we prepare for the\nretirement of the baby-boom generation. These scenarios suggest that, under a range of reasonably\nplausible assumptions about spending and taxes, we could be in a situation in the decades ahead in\nwhich rapid increases in the unified budget deficit set in motion a dynamic in which large deficits result\nin ever-growing interest payments that augment deficits in future years. The resulting rise in the\nfederal debt could drain funds away from private capital formation and thus over time slow the growth\nof living standards.\nFavorable productivity developments, of course, can help to alleviate the impending budgetary strains,\nbut no one should expect productivity growth to be sufficient to bail us out. Indeed, productivity would\nhave to grow at a rate far above its historical average to fully resolve the long-term financing problems\nof Social Security and Medicare. Higher productivity, of course, buoys expected revenues to the\nsystem, but it also raises Social Security obligations.1 Moreover, although productivity has no direct\nlink to Medicare spending, historical experience suggests that the demand for medical services\nincreases with real income, which over time rises in line with productivity.\nToday, federal outlays under Social Security and Medicare amount to less than 7 percent of GDP. In\nDecember, the CBO projected that these outlays would increase to 12 percent of GDP by 2030 under\ncurrent law, using assumptions about the growth of health-care costs similar to the intermediate\nassumptions of the Medicare trustees; when spending on Medicaid is added in, the rise in the ratio is\neven steeper. To be sure, the rise in these outlays relative to GDP could be financed by tax increases,\nbut the CBO results suggest that, even if other non-interest spending is constrained fairly tightly,\nensuring fiscal stability would require an overall federal tax burden well above its long-term average.\nMost experts believe that the best baseline for planning purposes is to assume that the demographic\nshift associated with the retirement of the baby-boom generation will be permanent - that is, it will not\nreverse when that cohort passes away. Indeed, so long as longevity continues to increase - and\nassuming no significant changes in immigration or fertility rates - the proportion of elderly in the\npopulation will only rise. If this fundamental change in the age distribution materializes, we will\neventually have no choice but to make significant structural adjustments in the major retirement\nprograms.\nOne change the Congress could consider as it moves forward on this critical issue is to replace the\ncurrent measure of the \"cost of living\" that is used for many purposes with respect to both revenues\nand outlays with a more appropriate price index. As you may be aware, in 2002, the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics introduced a new price index - the chained consumer price index (CPI). The new index is\nbased on the same underlying individual prices as is the official CPI. But it combines those prices so\nas to remove some of the inadvertent bias in the official price index, and thus it better measures\nchanges in the cost of living, the statutory intent of the indexing.2 All else being equal, had a chained\nCPI been used for indexing over the past decade, the cumulative unified budget deficit and thus the\nlevel of the federal debt would have been reduced about $200 billion; higher receipts and the\nreduction in debt service associated with those higher receipts account for roughly 60 percent of the\nsaving, with the remainder attributable to lower outlays. Shifting to the chain-weighted measure would\nnot address perhaps more fundamental shortcomings in the CPI - most notably the question of\nwhether quality improvement is adequately captured - but it would be an important step toward better\nimplementation of the intention of the Congress.\nAnother possible adjustment relates to the age at which Social Security and Medicare benefits will be\nprovided. Under current law, and even with the so-called normal retirement age for Social Security\nslated to move up to 67 over the next two decades, the ratio of the number of years that the typical\nworker will spend in retirement to the number of years he or she works will rise in the long term. A\ncritical step forward would be to adjust the system so that this ratio stabilizes. A number of specific\napproaches have been proposed for implementing this indexation, but the principle behind all of them\nis to insulate the finances of the system, at least to a degree, from further changes in life expectancy.\nSound private and public decisionmaking will be aided by determining ahead of the fact how one\nsource of risk, namely demographic developments, will be dealt with.\nThe degree of uncertainty about whether future resources will be adequate to meet our current\nstatutory obligations to the coming generations of retirees is daunting. The concern is not so much\nabout Social Security, where benefits are tied in a mechanical fashion to retirees' wage histories and\nwe have some useful tools for forecasting future outlays. The outlook for Medicare, however, is much\nmore difficult to assess. Although forecasting the number of program beneficiaries is reasonably\nstraightforward, we know very little about how rapidly medical technology will continue to advance and\nhow those innovations will translate into future spending. To be sure, technological innovations can\ngreatly improve the quality of medical care and can, in theory, reduce the costs of existing treatments.\nBut because medical technology expands the range of treatment options, it also has the potential of\nadding to overall spending - in some cases, significantly. As a result, the range of possible outlays per\nrecipient is extremely wide. This uncertainty is an important reason to be cautious - especially given\nthat government programs, whether for spending or for tax preferences, are easy to initiate but can be\nextraordinarily difficult to shut down once constituencies for them develop.\nIn view of this upward ratchet in government programs and the enormous uncertainty about the upper\nbounds of future demands for medical care, I believe that a thorough review of our spending\ncommitments - and at least some adjustment in those commitments - is necessary for prudent policy. I\nalso believe that we have an obligation to those in and near retirement to honor what has been\npromised to them. If changes need to be made, they should be made soon enough so that future\nretirees have time to adjust their plans for retirement spending and to make sure that their personal\nresources, along with what they expect to receive from the government, will be sufficient to meet their\nretirement needs.\nI certainly agree that the same scrutiny needs to be applied to taxes. However, tax rate increases of\nsufficient dimension to deal with our looming fiscal problems arguably pose significant risks to\neconomic growth and the revenue base. The exact magnitude of such risks is very difficult to estimate,\nbut they are of enough concern, in my judgment, to warrant aiming to close the fiscal gap primarily, if\nnot wholly, from the outlay side.\nThe dimension of the challenge is enormous. The one certainty is that the resolution of this situation\nwill require difficult choices and that the future performance of the economy will depend on those\nchoices. No changes will be easy, as they all will involve lowering claims on resources or raising\nfinancial obligations. It falls on the Congress to determine how best to address the competing claims.\nIn doing so, you will need to consider not only the distributional effects of policy change but also the\nbroader economic effects on labor supply, retirement behavior, and private saving.\nHistory has shown that, when faced with major challenges, elected officials have risen to the occasion.\nIn particular, over the past twenty years or so, the prospect of large deficits has generally led to\nactions to narrow them. I trust that the recent deterioration in the budget outlook and the\nfastapproaching retirement of the baby-boom generation will be met with similar determination and\neffectiveness.",

         "Susan Schmidt Bies: Qualitative aspects of effective risk management\nRemarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Global Association of Risk Professionals Fifth Annual Convention, New York,\n25 February 2004.\n* * *\nGood morning. I am delighted to be here for GARP's 5th Annual Risk Management Convention and to\nsupport, to the extent that I can, the work of your organization. It's gratifying to see the progress GARP\nhas made in its short life toward promoting the visibility and quality of the risk management profession.\nI congratulate you on the progress you have made and wish you further success in the years ahead.\nI have spent much of my own career in the field of risk management, and certainly the Federal\nReserve has a keen interest in the matter. For those of us who have spent more than a few years in\nthe business, it is easy to see the recent progress in the quantitative or scientific aspects of risk\nmanagement as a result of data base and other technological advances. These increased capabilities\nhave helped push financial theory and have opened doors and minds to new ways of measuring and\nmanaging risk.\nThese advances have also made possible the development of important new markets and products\nthat have become widespread and essential to the risk management practices of both financial and\nnonfinancial firms. They have also made the practice of risk management far more sophisticated and\ncomplex. The application of mathematics and statistics, the collection and compilation of large\namounts of data, and the analysis and characterization of the risks embedded in business activities\ntoday are much different - and in many ways more challenging - than they were not long ago.\nWhile the enhanced quantitative dimensions of risk measurement may be quite visible (at least to\npractitioners of the art), their implications for the qualitative aspects of risk management may be less\napparent. In practice, though, these qualitative aspects are no less important to the successful\noperation of a business - as events continue to demonstrate. As risk measurement practices advance,\nthe full range of risk management practices needs to keep pace.\nIn my remarks today, I would like to highlight some of the advances in risk management that we have\nseen in recent years, particularly those related to the management and transfer of credit risk. These\ngains and the development of new and important markets have come about because of better\nriskmeasurement techniques and have the potential, I believe, to substantially improve the efficiency of\nU.S. and world financial markets. However, as an economist, I also know there is no free lunch; some\nof the implications of these developments on the more fundamental elements of risk management\nmust be considered and adequately addressed if the quantitative aspects are to work well. For obvious\nreasons, I will focus on the practices of large commercial banks.\nCompetitive and innovative markets\nI would like to draw on some observations gathered from the Federal Reserve's role in banking\nsupervision as we have worked to better understand recent practices by financial institutions to\nmanage and transfer credit risk. I find the preliminary assessment to be informative, interesting, and at\nleast somewhat reassuring; however, I also feel that it appropriately highlights vulnerabilities in market\npractices that must be carefully monitored and managed. Because much of the innovation in credit risk\ntransfer involves credit derivatives, attention has been focused on transactions using these\ninstruments and on credit default swaps (CDS), in particular. By way of note, the Federal Reserve also\nis participating in work commissioned last year by the Financial Stability Forum to gain a broader\nunderstanding of these issues. I look forward to the conclusions and assessment in this regard.\nAs most of you know, credit default swaps involve the sale, or transfer, of credit risk associated with a\nspecific reference entity for a fixed term in exchange for a fee from the other counterparty (the\n\"protection buyer\"). Related instruments - synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) - entail\nsimilar arrangements, but are based on portfolios of exposures and are \"tranched\" in a manner\ntypically seen in securitizations. Consequently, through CDOs, parties gain even greater flexibility in\ntailoring and marketing financial transactions to match the risk appetites of ultimate investors, or risk\ntakers.\nThis market has grown rapidly in recent years, attracting increased attention among risk managers\nand leading to larger operations and higher staffing levels - particularly at dealer firms. The British\nBankers Association, for example, reports that the notional value of credit derivatives has grown from\nless than $200 billion in 1997 to nearly $2 trillion in 2002. Our own bank Call Reports indicate that late\nlast year U.S. commercial banks held credit derivatives with notional values of more than $800 billion,\nwhich may represent one-third of the global market. Trading of these instruments occurs mostly\namong some 1,200 large investment-grade \"reference entities,\" with more liquidity, of course, among\nthe most active fifty names than among the next several hundred. Most liquidity for CDS contracts is\nwith five-year maturities, although participants are trying to expand market depth at longer terms.\nThere are also efforts to push demand beyond investment-grade corporate names, for example to\nhigh-yield and middle-market sectors.\nA key question - how much risk is being transferred? - has been difficult to answer due to the\nparticipation in the market of many types of regulated and unregulated investors and firms as well as\nthe fact that participants simply reverse or close out one exposure by entering into an additional and\noffsetting one, as they do with other types of swaps. To be sure, notional amounts substantially\noverstate the level of risk transfer, but by most accounts, market participants seem to agree that the\nvolume of risk transferred has been material. Anecdotally, some of the largest banks indicate they\nhedge about 15 percent of their investment-grade corporate credit. Standard and Poor's estimates the\nbanking system globally has used credit derivatives to transfer the risk associated with some\n$300 billion of exposures. But S&P acknowledges that this estimate likely overstates the true level of\nrisk transferred because CDS are almost exclusively written on low-risk, investment-grade credits, and\nbecause banks issuing CDOs typically retain the riskier tranches.\nEven so, it seems to me that such risk management practices are important in governing credit risk in\nlarge banking organizations and, in many respects, reducing systemic risk, as well. Despite the\ncommon practice by banks that issue CDOs to retain much or all of the first-loss or \"expected-loss\"\ntranche, such banks have at least reduced their previous, full credit exposure. Moreover, the sale and\npurchase of CDS also allow banks to manage concentrations and to further diversify their portfolios. In\nthe event of highly unexpected defaults among investment-grade firms, a hedged bank's losses will be\nreduced. The experience with credit derivatives in the Enron, World Com, and Parmalat events,\nindicate that these new risk products can work effectively.\nOne aspect that we, as bank supervisors, find encouraging about the growth of credit risk transfer\nactivity is the diversification benefit it provides - and its potential for greater economic efficiency.\nCertainly, not all of the risk transferred by banks has left the banking sector. S&P estimates that\nroughly one-half of this risk remains in the banking sector. The insurance sector, including reinsurance\nfirms, has been a major participant among nonbank firms. Among banks, the belief is that those in\nEurope and Asia have been net sellers of credit protection, particularly with respect to North American\nborrowers. Such credit flows, whether within or outside the banking system, should help enhance the\ngeographic diversification of the protection-seller and add liquidity to the debt offerings of the\nreference firms.\nBy distributing risks more broadly among the major players - banks, insurance companies, hedge\nfunds, and private asset managers - these transactions would seem almost by definition to add to the\ndiversity and strength of financial markets and reduce risk concentrations. By their design, derivative\ninstruments segment risk for distribution to parties most willing to accept them. A key point, however,\nis that these parties are also able to do so by successfully absorbing and diffusing any subsequent\nloss. In any event, reducing or more evenly redistributing the risk within the banking system - where\nsuch credit risk has been traditionally concentrated - would seem to be a clear benefit.\nA second question that is certainly of interest to you as risk management professionals is whether\nparticipants recognize and understand the underlying risks. It is important to recognize that the market\nfor credit default swaps is dominated by large institutions and private investors that have specialized\nexpertise in credit analysis and significant historical performance records. Participants will always\nadjust their positions and move in and out of markets as they gain experience, and there will certainly\nbe lessons to learn along the way. We will learn them, and hopefully we will deal with them well - as\nwe have so far. But we have little evidence, to date, that suggests there are material weaknesses in\nthe knowledge and understanding of the major market-making dealers.\nThat said, I would offer one critical caveat regarding the potential for a large group of market\nparticipants to place an over-reliance on external ratings and key modeling assumptions. In particular,\nthe pricing and risk management of the increasingly complex credit risk transfer instruments and\ntrading strategies rely on credit risk models and supporting assumptions, including assumptions about\nthe degree of default correlations between different reference entities. Although these future\ncorrelations cannot be measured, correlations during periods of normal conditions can change greatly\nduring periods of stress. Time will tell how robust these models are and whether they will perform well.\nMarket participants must consider whether there is a concentration of reliance on a small set of risk\nmanagement frameworks or approaches in the Credit Risk Transfer (CRT) market. This issue arises in\nregard to the reported similarity of credit risk models and assumptions used by major market\nparticipants. Of course, there is nothing inherently wrong with convergence in risk management\napproaches. But in this case, given the widespread view that models are still in their relative infancy,\nthe similarities are perhaps worth noting. This issue also arises in relation to the reliance on rating\nagency ratings and methodologies regarding CDO tranches and related structures. Ideally, all market\nparticipants that are investing substantial amounts in CDOs would have the capacity to undertake their\nown analysis of the risks, so that the rating agency ratings would function more as a supplement to\nthese analyses. In practice, however, it is likely that substantial reliance will be placed on the rating\nagency's rating. Consequently, the risk judgments of many market participants are concentrated in the\nhands of a small number of public rating agencies.\nIn the context of commercial banking where past credit-related failures have had substantial and\nwidespread effects, we also have close government supervision, that has focused primarily on risk\nmanagement practices and controls relating to evolving market practices. I would not for a minute\nsuggest that such oversight ensures that all will go well in the future. But it should help to reinforce\neffective risk management, and we are learning from the growing list of case studies.\nQualitative aspects\nThis discussion of the role of derivatives in transferring credit risk serves to illustrate many important -\nand not always highly technical - aspects of risk management that cannot be overlooked. Some of\nthese issues relate to the nascent features of that particular market, but they apply to other markets as\nwell, and to the sheer complexity of measuring risk. Thoughts of legal risk, operational risk,\nreputational risk, counterparty credit risk, and model risk all come to mind. For their part, central\nbankers and bank supervisors must also consider the implications of new products, activities, and\nmanagement innovations on financial markets, systemic risk, and their own prudential regulations. The\ncombined implications of market innovations on all of these and other issues can be profound and\nchallenging, but, I would submit, overall beneficial to market efficiency. We simply must manage the\nprocess well.\nIn the legal arena, the financial industry has made, and continues to make, substantial progress, for\nexample, standardizing netting agreements related to derivative instruments and reducing related\nmisunderstandings and differences among institutions and legal jurisdictions. Understanding market\nfor\npractices, such as those related to settling transactions using \"cheapest to deliver,\" and knowing\ncertain the specific legal entities that are the reference parties on credit risk swaps are also crucial, low\ntech elements of a successful risk management process. Uncertainties will exist in any complicated\noperation. They are typically greater when associated with innovation and they grow as product\nstructures become more complex. We all need to recognize this.\nRegarding models, aside from the technical parts, it's important to consider the less quantitative. For\ninstance, are the inputs sound? Are the model parameters based on sufficiently robust and accurate\ndata? Are the assumptions reasonable? One needs to understand the business and risk management\nprinciples, but that does not require a \"quant.\" In modeling, \"GIGO\" - garbage in, garbage out - always\nrules.\nData integrity is growing in importance in effective risk management. In today's world of credit risk\nmodels, especially for centralized underwriting in areas such as consumer, mortgage, and small\nbusiness credit, the responsibilities of data input may reside with the lending officer. To ensure\neffective underwriting, the culture and incentives for loan officers should support accountability for\nvalid information going into a model.\nIn the \"old days\" when individual loan officers made credit decisions, any weaknesses in underwriting\nwere confined to that lender's portfolio. It was the responsibility of loan reviewers to identify those\nweaknesses before losses became extensive. Today, the responsibility for effectively predicting\ndefaults and loss given default resides with the senior credit officer responsible for the credit scoring\nmodel. When the underwriting results are then tested for reliability, it is critical to identify the root\ncause of errors due to model specifications and changes in customer behavior. The risk of centralized,\nmodel-based underwriting is that errors are no longer limited to the portfolio of a single loan officer.\nRather, model errors can create significant systemic risks across that loan product portfolio. We are\nstill trying to learn how to estimate these types of risks.\nIn our current regulatory efforts to develop internal rating-based capital standards for credit risk, we\nfind that simply identifying and describing \"minimum\" data requirements can be a challenge. What is\nadequate and robust for a given purpose and what is not? Each company's practices are unique - as\nthey should be. We do not wish to create the moral hazard and greater systemic risk associated with a\nhighly specific, government-dictated procedure to measure risk. Rather, we want the discipline that\ncan be gained from requiring that the input data and the parameters used for regulatory purposes are\nas much as possible - the same as those used for business purposes, so that they can be\nmarkettested. Differences among model results will occur, but both management and regulators must decide\nwhat is good enough for their respective purposes. Some answers are more judgmental than\nempirical. Experience, judgment, and a sound degree of prudence are all important.\nIn the old days, banking was often a smaller and certainly less complex business. In this smaller scale,\nmanagement could gain a more direct \"feel\" about their customers, their exposures, and the related\nrisk. And the potential consequences of making mistakes were typically small as well. If the bank had\na bad loan underwriter, it could dismiss the person and proceed to clean up the mess. As many\nbanking organizations have grown into much larger and far more complex institutions, that personal\nneed\nfeel often gets lost. Their managements the more sophisticated and systematic processes that\nrisk modeling can provide, but they also need to ensure that an incorrect or weak model does not bring\ndown the house. I would offer that success in this area often requires grey hair and keen intuition as\nwell as highly developed analytical skills.\nBeyond these points, accounting and disclosure practices must be considered as they relate to such\nmatters as earnings volatility, customer suitability, and the incentives or disincentives they provide to\nrisk managers. Fundamental elements of corporate governance must also be adequately addressed -\nand they naturally become more challenging as activities become more complex. Nevertheless, they\ncannot be ignored, given the corporate scandals of recent years and the legislated remedies that\nfollowed.\nRecent failures of corporate governance - whether at Enron, Parmalat, or the New York Stock\nExchange - have changed the landscape underlying many transactions conducted by financial\ninstitutions. The implications of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation are now being felt throughout corporate\nAmerica and are proving to be expensive to many firms. How much better, for all, had these few\ncorporations behaved more responsibly all along! Responsible self-governance and sound corporate\ngovernance are much better and far less costly than rigid governmental-imposed rules. A greater\nawareness of business ethics and a reshaping of accounting practices and incentive packages should\nhelp. But risk managers must also play an active role in focusing on sound practices, and not just on\nexpedience.\nAccounting, disclosure, and market discipline\nRevelations of significant corporate governance and accounting failures, with Parmalat being the latest\nexample, demonstrate that strong accounting, effective internal and external auditing, and transparent\ndisclosure practices are critical concerns worldwide, not just in one part of the world, such as the\nUnited States. Events at the international level have renewed attention to the need for companies\nworldwide to implement high-quality corporate governance practices and accounting and disclosure\nstandards, and for their external auditors to employ rigorous and sound international auditing\ntechniques. Long before coming to the Federal Reserve, I had a strong interest and became involved\nin accounting, auditing, and internal control matters. This led to my serving on the Financial\nAccounting Standard Board's Emerging Issues Task Force and the Committee on Corporate\nReporting of the Financial Executives Institute. I have continued to pursue this interest in my role as a\nFederal Reserve Board member and as chair of the Board's Committee on Supervisory and\nRegulatory Affairs. I would like, now, to turn to some of the recent accounting issues surrounding\ncomplex instruments and the role of financial disclosure in promoting risk management.\nFor starters, I am pleased to see movement in recognizing employee stock options grants as a\nbusiness expense. At year-end 2003, thirty-five of the fifty largest U.S. bank holding companies that\nwe closely monitor each quarter were taking this approach, a notable increase from the year before.\nMany nonbank firms are doing so as well, and we should expect to see many more companies do so\nin periods ahead. In my view, that is a useful step toward more accurately disclosing a company's true\nresults, and one that should help rebuild investor confidence in financial statements.\nThe techniques for valuing financial derivatives - whether they be employee stock options, mortgage\ninterest rate lock commitments, credit default swaps, or another type - are continuing to evolve. As\nthese markets grow, fair-value estimates will only improve. In the process, firms of all types will face\ngrowing competitive pressures to manage risk more effectively and to make greater use of these and\nother products. Accounting rules and disclosure practices must keep pace. A frequently cited issue is\nthe effect of current hedge accounting rules, which sometimes cause banks to recognize losses on\ncredit hedges while ignoring, in earnings, the offsetting gains in the economic value of the asset\nhedged. This leads to greater earnings volatility and has understandably caused some banks to\nreassess, and in some cases scale back, their credit hedging activities.\nIf market discipline is to function, accounting boards themselves must find better, more-innovative\nsolutions that more accurately capture the underlying economics of transactions. Moreover, with\nregard to securitizations, derivatives, and other innovative instruments that can transfer risk, it is not at\nall clear that accounting measures of a company's balance sheet at a given point in time are sufficient\nto reflect the company's financial risk profile.\nAs bank regulators, we recognize the need to strike the right balance in deciding what disclosure\nstandards to promote. It is said that for every complex issue there is an answer that is simple, concise,\nand wrong. We would prefer to get it right. We need to identify the information that sufficiently informs\ninvestors of risk levels without being unduly burdensome and without revealing proprietary information.\nMuch of the answer may involve disclosures about how risks are being managed and valued, drawing\nless on accounting information and more on information available in risk management reports.\nDisclosures need not be fully standardized; rather each firm should tell its own story.\nOne area in which improved disclosures by banking organizations are needed involves credit risk and\nthe allowance for loan losses. As you know, there is a high degree of management judgment in\nestimating the loan-loss allowance, and that estimate can have a significant impact on an institution's\nbalance sheet and earnings. Expanded disclosures in this area would improve market participants'\nunderstanding of an institution's risk profile and whether the firm has adequately provided for its\nestimated credit losses in a consistent, well-disciplined manner. Accordingly, I strongly encourage\ninstitutions to provide additional disclosures in this area. Examples include a breakdown of credit\nexposures by internal credit grade, the allowance estimates broken down by key components,\nmorethorough discussions of why allowance components have changed from period to period, and\nenhanced discussions of the rationale behind changes in the more-subjective allowance estimates,\nincluding unallocated amounts.\nIt is also important to note that the soon-to-be-released enterprise risk management (ERM) framework\nof the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, should\nprovide much needed guidance in the areas of risk management and internal controls and, thus, is of\nparticular interest to bank regulators. The ERM framework, as proposed, requires an entity to identify\nthe potential events that may affect its operations and requires the entity to systematically manage\nthose risks with a particular emphasis on its risk appetite and strategic direction. The framework is\npredicated on the existence of sound controls and effective management. Successful application of\nthe framework requires managers to consider both current and planned or anticipated operational and\nmarket changes and to identify the risks arising from those changes. Once these risks have been\nidentified comprehensively, assessed, and evaluated as to their potential impact on the organization,\nmanagement must determine the effectiveness of existing controls and develop and implement\nadditional mitigating controls where needed. This is a critical step and if it is not performed properly, it\nmay doom the entire process.\nOne of the weaknesses that we have seen is the delegation by management of both the development\nand the assessment of the internal control structure to the same risk management, internal control, or\ncompliance group. It is important to emphasize that line management has the responsibility for\nidentifying risks and ensuring that the mitigating controls are effective - and to leave the assessments\nto a group that is independent of that line organization. Managers should be expected to evaluate the\nrisks and controls within their scope of authority at least annually and to report the results of this\nprocess to the chief risk officer and the audit committee of the board of directors. An independent\ngroup, such as internal audit, should perform a separate assessment to confirm management's\nassessment.\nInternal audit's review should determine whether the firm is accomplishing its stated control objectives,\nin light of growth and changes in the firm's business mix as well as in regard to new customers,\nstrategic initiatives, reorganizations, and process changes. Internal audit should also evaluate the\nentity's adherence to its control processes and assess the adequacy of those processes and its\nrelated disclosure practices in light of the complexity and legal and reputational risk profile of the\norganization. It is essential for internal audit to be staffed with personnel who have the necessary skills\nand experience to report on the degree of compliance with an entity's policies and procedures. Internal\naudit should test transactions to validate that business lines are complying with the firm's standards\nand should report the results of that testing to the board or the audit committee, as appropriate.\nAlthough I have referred to internal audit, the key point is that strong internal controls, sound corporate\ngovernance, and effective disclosure practices require that periodic assessments of overall\neffectiveness be performed by an independent group. Then, as corporate disclosure practices evolve,\nmarket analysts must do their part to understand the information, while recognizing both its value and\nits limitations. Analysts need to make sure they are correctly using all available information. This\nincludes understanding that some accounting practices may not result in the best presentation of\neconomic reality and that other sources of information may provide more-accurate insight into a\ncompany's condition.\nFor example, current accounting rules for defined-benefit pension plans permit firms to use\nexpectations of the long-term return on assets to calculate current-period pension costs. A spot rate is\nused to discount future liabilities. The discrepancies between the assumed and the actual returns are\nreconciled by gradual amortization. This smoothing feature can create large distortions between\neconomic reality and the pension-financing cost accrual embedded in the income statement.\nA recent study by Federal Reserve staff members indicates that \"full disclosure\" of the underlying\ndetails would not necessarily assist the analyst in reaching a \"correct\" judgment.1 The study adopts the\npremise that most of what investors need to know about true pension-financing costs can be reflected\nin two numbers disclosed in the pension footnote. These two numbers are the fair-market value of the\npension assets and the present value of outstanding pension liabilities. The study finds that these two\nnumbers tend to be ignored by investors in favor of the potentially misleading accounting measures.\nInvestors and analysts need to ensure that the information they are using most accurately reflects the\norganization under consideration. Also, bank employees who use financial statements of potential\nborrowers to make credit-related decisions need to understand the documents they are using and be\nable to identify potential shortfalls.\nToo often, analysts have relied too heavily on projections and interpretations given to them by\nmanagement. Recent events have injected more independence into the analysis process and should\nhelp wean many analysts from CFOs and investor relations departments. More-insightful and\nmoreindependent analysis by them can help greatly in promoting market discipline and identifying a\ncompany's true worth. That progress, in turn, strengthens the input data and the risk-measurement\nsystems we all rely on.\nThroughout its supervisory and regulatory efforts, the Federal Reserve is, indeed, looking more to\nmarket signals. For example, information contained in subordinated debt spreads, credit default swap\nspreads, KMV EDFs, and equity prices provide useful indications of the market's collective\nassessment of a company's underlying risk. In banks, this information supports credit judgments and\noverall measures of the institution's capital adequacy and credit risk. As regulators worldwide move to\nfinalize new capital standards, the role of market information in risk management should grow further,\nparticularly among the largest banks, as it will in our own oversight activities.\nBefore closing, I would like to take off my central banker hat and speak to you only as an industry\nobserver and a former bank CFO. I want to simply note the historically low level of interest rates which\nare not within the work experience of many investment and risk managers. The typical response is to\ntry to increase nominal yields and widen spreads. Thus, some banks have acted to extend portfolio\ndurations and accept risk, given the steep yield curve, because statistics will likely tell you that the\nodds of a rate increase are greater than a further decline. We are also seeing some investors attempt\nto increase nominal yields by investing in lower-rated bonds. But the skills that this association's\nmembers practice, remind us that the goal should be appropriate \"risk management,\" that is, given an\norganization's risk appetite, the attractiveness of higher yields must always be balanced against the\nincreased level of risk in the transaction. And in times of turns in business and interest rate cycles,\nestimating these tradeoffs can be more difficult. That is not a prediction of near or future rate\nmovements - just advice from an experienced manager of interest rate risk.\nConclusion\nIn my remarks this morning, I have sought to encourage you to continue your efforts to support the\nevolution of risk-management practices and heighten the degree of professionalism that every\neffective risk manager should demonstrate. I would like to leave by reminding all of you not to become\nso caught up in the latest technical development that you lose sight of the qualitative aspects of your\nresponsibilities. Models alone do not guarantee an effective risk-management process. You should\nencourage continuous improvement in all aspects, including some I mentioned today - data integrity,\nlegal clarity, transparent disclosures, and internal controls.",

         "Edward M Gramlich: Budget and trade deficits - linked, both worrisome in the\nlong run, but not twins\nRemarks by Mr Edward M Gramlich, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Euromoney Bond Investors Congress, London, 25 February 2004.\n* * *\nThank you for inviting me to speak today. While I know that most of you would welcome any insights I\nmight have about current U.S. monetary policy - whether the Open Market Committee will be raising or\nlowering interest rates at our next meeting - I prefer to focus instead on some issues that could\nbecome serious over the longer run. These issues involve the persistent budget and trade deficits\nfacing the American economy, issues that could eventually involve significant economic adjustments\naround the world.1\nLarge budget and trade deficits are not a new phenomenon. They also arose in the United States in\nthe mid-1980s. At that time, the business press and many economists began referring to the situation\nas one of \"twin deficits.\" With the current re-emergence of both deficits, the phrase has come back into\ncommon usage - too common, in my view.\nTo be sure, in theoretical models there is a scenario by which budget deficits can create trade deficits,\nand one by which trade deficits can create budget deficits. But there are also many scenarios by which\neither deficit can arise independently, or even by which budget and trade deficits can move in opposite\ndirections, as they did in the 1990s. In general, while budget and trade deficits can be linked, there are\nimportant differences between the two, both in how they respond to economic forces and in their\nlong-run consequences.\nI start by examining the relationship between budget and trade deficits - why they are linked but not\ntwins. I discuss the sustainability conditions for budget and trade deficits; the conditions that must be\nfulfilled for the debts on both accounts to be stabilized in relation to the size of the U.S. economy.\nThen I discuss what happens if either debt violates this condition and rises in relation to the size of the\neconomy. This discussion, in turn, raises further interesting distinctions between the two deficits.\nThe link\nThe link between budget and trade deficits can be seen most naturally through the national income\naccounting framework. Any saving the nation does finances either private domestic investment directly\nor the accumulation of claims on foreigners. This means that national saving - the sum of private and\ngovernment saving - equals private domestic investment plus that period's accumulation of claims on\nforeigners, or the trade surplus. The trade surplus can also be thought of as net foreign lending. All of\nthese relationships are accounting identities - true at every moment in time apart from data\ninconsistencies captured by a statistical discrepancy.\nIn equation form, we have\nNS = S - BD = I - TD (1)\nOn the left side of the equation NS refers to national saving, S refers to overall private saving, and BD\nrefers to the government budget deficit. This part of the equation says merely that total national saving\nequals the sum of all saving done in the economy by the private sector and the government sector. A\nbudget surplus would be treated as governmental saving and added to private saving; a budget deficit\nwould be treated as governmental dissaving and subtracted.\nThe right side of the equation repeats the familiar open economy identity that national saving equals\nprivate domestic investment, I, plus the accumulation of claims on foreigners or less that domestic\ninvestment financed by foreigners. As was noted earlier, borrowing from foreigners involves either a\nreduction of claims on them or an increase of claims on us by them. It is by definition equal to the\ntrade deficit TD. In the equation, then, a trade surplus means that some national saving goes to\nbuilding up claims on foreigners (national saving is greater than domestic investment) while a trade\ndeficit means that some investment is financed by foreigners (national saving is less than domestic\ninvestment).\nThis identity first demonstrates the all-important role of national saving in shaping long-run economic\nwelfare. National saving is the only way a country can have its capital and own it too. Models of the\neconomic growth process identify national saving as one of the key policy variables in influencing a\nnation's living standards in the long run.\nThe identity also makes clear that the budget deficit and the trade deficit can move together on a\ndollar-per-dollar basis, but only if the difference between private domestic investment and private\nsaving is constant. Typically that difference will not be constant. For example, if there were to be an\ninvestment boom, interest rates might rise to induce some new private saving and some new lending\nby foreigners. The implied trade deficit might rise and, because of the rise in income, the budget deficit\nmight fall. In this case, the trade deficit would increase while the budget deficit fell.\nConversely, suppose that expansionary fiscal policy resulted in a rise in budget deficits. If this\nexpansion were totally financed by borrowing from foreigners, domestic interest rates would not\nchange much, and domestic investment and private saving might not either. In this scenario, there\ncould be a simultaneous dollar-per-dollar change in budget and trade deficits - the classic twin-deficit\nscenario. Such a situation is most likely to occur in small economies fully open to international trade\nand capital flows, economies in which domestic interest rates are determined by world capital markets\nand are independent of domestic economic variables. But if domestic interest rates do change, as they\nlikely would in either a closed economy or a large open economy, private investment and saving would\nalso likely change, and any strict link between budget and trade deficits would be broken.\nOne could spin any number of scenarios, but these are enough to make the basic point. Because of\nthe underlying relationship between saving and investment, budget and trade deficits could be strictly\nlinked. But in a large open economy like the United States, it is easy to imagine plenty of scenarios in\nwhich they are imperfectly linked, and even some scenarios in which they move in opposite directions.\nBudget and trade deficits should be viewed as linked, but not as twins.\nStability conditions\nAlthough the economic implications and reactions of budget deficits and trade deficits differ, both are\ndeficits. Another elementary accounting identity says that last period's debt level plus the current\ndeficit equals the current period's debt level. This identity is true whether we are talking about budget\ndeficits building up the stock of outstanding government debt (a liability of the government sector to\nthe private sector), or trade deficits building up the stock of external debt (the net stock of accumulated\nforeign claims against the United States).2\nEconomists have worried for years about optimal stocks of government and external debt. For\ngovernment debt, the optimal stock turns out to be related to the optimal level of national saving, which\ncan be defined as the level that maximizes the nation's long-term path of consumption per worker. The\noptimal stock of net external debt can be determined in the same framework from an open economy\nperspective.\nWhile these models can be instructive, today I am going to focus on a weaker standard. Whatever the\nlong-term optimal level of government debt, and whatever the optimal level of external debt, one can\nseparately ask whether either debt level is becoming a more, or less, important economic factor over\ntime. For government debt, this weaker standard, or stability condition, determines merely whether the\nratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) is stable. If it is, interest payments on the debt will, in\nequilibrium, also settle down to a stable proportion of GDP. For external debt, a stable debt-to-GDP\nratio means that the net interest and dividend payments of the United States to foreign investors will\nalso settle down to a constant ratio to GDP.\nThe appendix derives this stability condition generically. It is that\nd\n(g - i)/(1 + g) = p, (2)\nwhere d is the stable ratio of debt to GDP, g is the nominal growth rate of the economy, i is the\nnominal interest rate in the economy, and p is the ratio of the primary deficit to GDP. For budget\naccounts, the primary deficit is the national income accounts budget deficit, but excluding interest\npayments. For trade accounts, the primary trade deficit is the current account deficit, excluding net\ninterest and dividend payments to foreigners.3\nAs a general rule, the economy's growth rate and interest rate will be fairly close. The equation says\nthat if they are equal, the primary deficit must be zero to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. If the interest\nrate is slightly above the growth rate, as it would be in models without risk for economies that save\nless than the theoretical optimum, a nation with outstanding debt would have to run a slight primary\nsurplus to stabilize its debt-to-GDP ratio. If the effective interest rate on debt is slightly below the\ngrowth rate, as it has generally been found to be in the past for both deficits, a nation with outstanding\ndebt could run slight primary deficits and not see the debt ratio grow.4\nOn the foreign side, this condition has until now been especially forgiving. Even with a large net debt\nposition, our net investment income from foreigners has exceeded that paid out to foreigners. Since\nthe net interest rate has been less than the GDP growth rate, the ratio of external debt to GDP could\nhave been stabilized with a moderate primary trade deficit.5\nMagnitudes\nIt is well known that the U.S. economy now suffers both budget and trade deficits. But how do these\ndeficits compare with the stability conditions?\nHistorically, there have not been significant instabilities in U.S. federal budget deficits.6 Overall deficits\nhave averaged about 2 percent of GDP over the past four decades, but Figure 1 shows that when\ninterest is deducted, primary budget deficits have averaged close to zero, the approximate level that\nstabilizes the debt-to-GDP ratio. Hence, the outstanding debt, while fluctuating in the range of\n25 percent to 50 percent of GDP, has actually declined slightly as a share of GDP. It was 38 percent of\nGDP in the mid-1960s and is now only 37 percent of GDP. The ratio did rise as high as 50 percent in\nthe high-deficit years of the early 1990s, but it dropped sharply thereafter with the primary budget\nsurpluses of the late 1990s.\nLooking ahead, things might not be so favorable. As a result of recent fiscal changes, the budget has\nlately fallen into primary deficit again; this primary deficit is now more than 2 percent of GDP\n(1.5 percent after cyclical adjustment). The deterioration reflects the much-discussed recent rapid\ngrowth in expenditures, along with significant tax cuts. Perhaps more significant, in a few years the\nUnited States will face huge looming costs for retirement and health programs. It will take\nextraordinary fiscal discipline just to keep the present primary deficit near its current level of 1 to\n2 percent of GDP over the short, medium, and long run. And even at that level, the stability condition is\nviolated by at least 1 percent of GDP, suggesting that the debt-to-GDP ratio is likely to climb steadily\nupward.7\n3\nThis primary trade deficit differs from the trade deficit component of GDP mentioned earlier because it includes foreign\ntransfers and other small items.\n4\nLaurence Ball, Douglas W. Elmendorf, and N. Gregory Mankiw, \"The Deficit Gamble\", Journal of Money, Credit, and\nBanking, vol. 30, no. 4, (November 1998), pp. 699-720, show that interest rates on domestic government debt have\ngenerally been slightly less than the GDP growth rate in past decades.\n5\nThe rate-of-return puzzle is in turn a question about why foreign direct investment in the United States has such a low rate\nof return. See Raymond J. Mataloni, Jr., \"An Examination of the Low Rates of Return of Foreign-Owned U.S. Companies\",\nSurvey of Current Business, vol. 80 (March 2000), pp. 55-73.\n6\nEven though the previous identity referred to the consumption budget for the entire government sector, in this section I\nswitch over to the familiar concept of the total budget for the U.S. federal government. State and local governments more or\nless finance their current spending and do not have much outstanding debt apart from that backed by capital formation; and\nfederal capital investment is very small.\n7\nThese statements are based on estimates of the Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook, Fiscal\nYears 2005 to 2014 (January 2004). A further discussion of the long-run budget outlook can be found in Alan J. Auerbach,\nWilliam G. Gale, Peter R. Orszag, and Samara R. Potter, \"Budget Blues: The Fiscal Outlook and Options for Reform,\" in\nHenry J. Aaron, James Lindsay, and Pietro Nivola (eds.), Agenda for the Nation (The Brookings Institution, 2003). See also\nthe General Accounting Office, Truth and Transparency: The Federal Government's Financial Condition and Fiscal Outlook\nBIS Review 12/2004\nOn the trade side, Figure 2 shows that the trend is definitely more worrisome. While the budget debt\nhas fluctuated between 25 percent and 50 percent of GDP over the past several decades, the net\nexternal debt has grown steadily. Until 1985, this external debt was not even positive; that is, until that\ntime the United States had net claims on foreigners. But because the United States has run persistent\nand sizable primary trade deficits since 1990, the net external debt is now 25 percent of GDP and\nrising sharply. The primary trade deficit is now 5 percent of GDP, violating the stability condition by\nnearly this same amount. At this rate, the external debt ratio will climb very quickly.\nWhile the trade deficit does have equilibrating tendencies, as will be discussed later, there are also\nforces that tend to increase it. Econometric studies of the basic demand for imports and exports find\nthat the U.S. income elasticity of demand for imports is higher than the foreign income elasticity of\ndemand for U.S. exports. This means that even if the world economy grows at the same rate as the\nU.S. economy, our trade deficit is likely to widen, (apart from any changes in relative prices).8 Indeed,\nthe U.S. primary trade deficit has widened steadily since 1990.\nAdjustments\nI have just argued that the U.S. is now in violation of the stability condition for both budget and trade\ndeficits - recently and moderately on the budget side, persistently and significantly on the trade side.\nWhat are the implications?\nWith each deficit there is probably a credibility range. By that, I mean a limited range within which a\ncountry may be able to violate its stability condition and have its debt-to-GDP ratio trend upward\nwithout further economic consequences. For budgets, there may be a range within which the\ndebtto-GDP ratio can grow without significant changes in interest rates.9 As equation 1 indicates, economic\nperformance in this range is by no means optimal, because the persistent deficits are subtracting\nfunds that would otherwise be devoted to capital investment and future growth in living standards. But\nthere may not be significant relative price effects. The same is true on the trade side; there could be a\nrange in which foreign claims on the United States just build up without major impact on relative\nprices.\nOnce the economy gets outside of the credibility range, more significant relative price adjustments\nbecome likely. On the trade side, for example, the continued accumulation of foreign claims on the\nU.S. economy will raise the issue of whether foreign investors will want to hold an ever-increasing\nshare of their wealth in the form of U.S. assets. Or, as is the focus of the stability condition above,\nwhether the U.S. economy can indefinitely pay out ever-higher shares of GDP in the form of interest\nand dividend payments. The conventional view is that at some point there should be a relative price\nadjustment - some combination of rising U.S. interest rates (to make U.S. assets more attractive),\nrising foreign prices (to make imports more expensive), moderating U.S. prices (to make U.S. exports\nmore competitive), or a change in exchange rates. Each of these reactions is likely to occur naturally,\nand each moves in the direction of lowering the external imbalance. That is why foreign trade deficits\nare typically thought of as self-correcting. The main risk here is that the natural adjustments may not\noccur gradually, but so rapidly as to threaten various types of dislocations.\nThere are complicating factors. One involves the currency denomination of the net debt. Countries\nwith large trade deficits often have their external liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Hence,\nwhen their own currency depreciates, the value and burden of foreign debt automatically increases.\nThe United States does not have this problem because most of its debt is denominated in dollars -\nsay, foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury bills. If the dollar were to fall, the value of our debt in terms of\nforeign currencies would then automatically decline, inducing foreign wealth-holders to make further\nportfolio shifts, perhaps even including increasing their stock of dollar-denominated debt. This\ndenomination effect would not permanently prevent any relative price adjustment, but it could lengthen\nthe process.\nBeyond that, for pragmatic reasons this conventional adjustment process could be extended or\ndistorted even further. By way of illustration, Asian central banks have now accumulated more than a\ntrillion dollars of international currency reserves - largely in dollar-denominated assets - equal to\nroughly half of the outstanding net debt of the United States. These central banks are not traditional\nwealth-holders motivated by expected risks and returns. Instead, they seem motivated more by the\nprospect of preserving low domestic currency values for their exporters.10 To pursue this objective,\nthey can print money to buy U.S. securities. This monetary expansion could generate domestic\ninflation unless it is sterilized with other open market sales of securities - and the mere scale of\npresent and expected future debt stocks may make continued sterilization impossible. But if these\ncentral banks continue behaving this way, the so-called credibility range could be extended\nsignificantly.\nWhile trade deficits should ultimately correct themselves, perhaps after a long trek through the\ncredibility range, there are really no natural self-corrective mechanisms for budget deficits. Once the\nU.S. economy gets through the credibility range, interest rates on the increasing government debt will\nhave to rise to induce people to hold the debt. This rise increases the interest burden and causes total\ndeficits to rise further, all the time subtracting more and more funds from capital accumulation. Once\nthis process begins, market psychology may hasten the adjustment.11 Hence, while natural forces\nlessen the basic external imbalance, they increase the basic budget imbalance. In the long run, the\nonly way to correct budget deficits is for policymakers to correct them.\nOutside forces\nThere are several outside forces - both natural and as a result of policy - that could influence budget\nand trade deficits.\nOne generally helpful influence is productivity growth. Say the U.S. economy benefits from an\nexogenous positive shock to productivity growth, as it seemed to have in the late 1990s. This shock\nwould raise the trend path of income, meaning that slightly higher primary budget and trade deficits\ncould still be consistent with debt-to-GDP stability; in effect, a higher level of g can be plugged into\nequation 2 (at least as long as it is not offset by a higher i). Higher productivity could also help\nlengthen the credibility range, the range in which moderate changes in the debt ratio might not lead to\nadverse changes in relative prices. Among other things, higher productivity could raise the marginal\nproduct of capital and make investment in U.S. assets relatively attractive. But even with these\nfavorable developments, the stability conditions discussed above still hold. If they are violated, the\nnatural adjustment mechanisms will eventually take over for the trade deficit, and the primary budget\ndeficit will eventually have to be reduced to stop a growing government debt ratio.\nOne unhelpful measure is trade protectionism. While it might appear that trade protectionism would\ncorrect trade deficits, it probably will not. Over the medium and long run, the economy should be\nproducing near its natural growth path, perhaps because of timely monetary and/or fiscal policy,\nperhaps because of natural equilibrating forces in the economy. In this event, trade protectionism\nwould not stimulate added national production. Even if protectionist measures reduce imports, the\nadded spending demands for import-competing industries will crowd out other types of production. Put\nanother way, equation 1 shows that the trade deficit is ultimately determined by national saving and\ninvestment. Without a change in these, protectionism merely shifts the types of goods that are\nproduced. It does not increase overall production and, short of cutting off trade altogether, does not\neven change the trade balance. Moreover, as is well known, over the long run, trade protection lowers\na nation's standard of living.\nFinally, suppose politicians actually do correct budget deficits, again assuming an economy near its\nmedium-term growth path. As mentioned above, such a fiscal austerity policy is the only known way to\ncorrect persistent budget deficits. The reduction in deficits should lower domestic interest rates and\ntrigger changes in exchange rates that lower imports and raise exports. Hence, well-designed fiscal\nausterity measures could solve all the problems simultaneously. They correct budget deficits directly,\nthey reduce trade deficits indirectly, and the implied higher level of national saving also permits more\nfunds to flow into capital formation and long-term productivity enhancements. Fiscal austerity is the\none tried and true approach to dealing with budget and trade deficits simultaneously.\nConclusions\nThere are obviously strong links between budget and trade deficits, and the deficit-debt dynamic\nrelationships are very similar. At the same time, it is misleading simply to equate the two deficits, as is\noften done in the twin-deficit literature. Budget deficits typically involve a reduction in national saving\nand, if large, a steadily growing government debt-to-GDP ratio. They typically will not be corrected\nwithout explicit action. Trade deficits, on the other hand, typically involve an increase in foreign claims\non the U.S. economy. As these claims grow in relation to national income, at least some natural forces\nare set in motion to correct the imbalance.\nFrom a policy standpoint, neither deficit may be terribly harmful in the short run, and at least the recent\nfiscal deficits have been useful in stabilizing movements in output. Moreover, there is likely to be a\ncredibility range in which debt levels could rise relative to GDP without much change in relative prices.\nIn the long run, however, both deficits could become much more worrisome. There are forces tending\nto increase both deficits: political and demographic for budget deficits, income elasticities for trade\ndeficits. At some point, continued large-scale trade deficits could trigger equilibrating, and possibly\ndislocating, changes in prices, interest rates, and exchange rates. Continued budget deficits will\nsteadily detract from the growth of the U.S. capital stock and may also trigger dislocating changes.\nAppendix: Derivation of the stability condition\nLet P denote the primary deficit (for either budget or trade), D the debt for either, and i the nation's\nnominal riskless interest rate. Then apart from valuation adjustments\nD = D-1 (1 + i) + P (A1)\nDivide through by GDP (Y):\nD/ Y = (D-1 /Y-1 )* (1 + i)/(1 + g) + P/Y.

         "Ben S Bernanke: Euro at five - ready for a global role?\nRemarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Institute for International Economics Conference, Washington, DC, 26 February 2004.\nThe references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.\n* * *\n\"What is the appropriate domain of a currency area? It might seem at first that the\nquestion is purely academic since it hardly appears within the realm of political\nfeasibility that national currencies would ever be abandoned in favor of any other\narrangement.\" Robert A. Mundell (1961, p. 657)\nIt is an honor for me to address such a distinguished group on the occasion of the euro's fifth\nanniversary. I congratulate the Institute of International Economics for putting together such an\nexcellent program.\nThe successful introduction, five years ago, of an entirely new currency over a wide range of polities\nand economies was, at a minimum, a remarkable technical achievement. As a card-carrying member\nof the club of monetary economists, I like to think that our collective expertise was helpful in making\nthat achievement possible. As both a policymaker and an economist, I welcome this opportunity to\nlook back on the first five years of the euro to see what we can learn from the experience and to\nconsider what this grand experiment implies for the future. I should say at the outset that, as usual, my\nremarks this evening reflect my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System.1\nThe economic analysis of optimal currency areas began, of course, with Robert Mundell's seminal\n1961 paper, from which I have quoted above.2 As you know, Mundell argued that, ideally, economic\nsimilarity, not political boundaries, should define the geographic area spanned by a common currency.\nHe was the first to state the classic tradeoff implied by the decision to adopt a common currency.\nAccording to Mundell, the principal advantage of a common currency is the reduction in transaction\ncosts implied by the use of a common medium of exchange across a broad area. The disadvantage of\na common currency is the loss of the shock-absorber properties of flexible exchange rates and\nindependent monetary policies. Flexible exchange rates and independent monetary policies will be\nuseful shock absorbers to the extent that macroeconomic shocks are imperfectly correlated across\nregions, wages and prices are sticky, and other macroeconomic adjustment mechanisms - such as\nfactor mobility or fiscal transfers among regions - are weak or absent. Thus, from the Mundellian\nperspective, the case for a common currency within a broad area is stronger, the greater the actual or\npotential economic and financial integration within the area; the greater the correlation of\nmacroeconomic shocks among regions within the area; and the more effective the non-monetary\nshock absorbers, such as factor mobility.\nWhether the nations that compose the European Monetary Union (EMU) form an optimal currency\narea in Mundell's sense has been widely debated by researchers. For example, Barry Eichengreen\nargued early on (Eichengreen, 1992) that Europe was perhaps not well suited for a common currency\non economic grounds (though he found the political motivations more compelling). According to\nEichengreen, the factors reducing the desirability of a monetary union in Europe included the historical\nvariability of real exchange rates among European nations, the low degree of labor mobility between\ncountries, and a lower correlation of underlying shocks among European countries than among\nregions of the United States.3 Other critics of monetary unification, such as Martin Feldstein, have\nstressed the limited extent of fiscal transfers within the European Union. Differences across countries\nin the nature and strength of the monetary policy transmission mechanism are another factor that may\nreduce the attractiveness of a monetary union.4 However, some more recent assessments, which\nhave emphasized factors such as the high propensity of European countries to trade with each other\nand the increased coherence of national business cycles within Europe, have generally been more\nfavorable (Alesina, Barro, and Tenreyro, 2002; Agresti and Mojon, 2001). Of course, analyses that\nlook only at historical conditions ignore the important possibility that monetary union itself may induce\nendogenous changes in trade propensities, the pattern of macroeconomic shocks, and other\ncomponents of the Mundellian analysis, a point that Eichengreen and many other authors have made.\nRather than pursuing the question of whether Europe is in fact an optimal currency area in Mundell's\nsense, I think it is useful simply to recognize that the European experiment in economic and monetary\nunion has not been motivated primarily by Mundellian factors. (Mundell himself did not expect that\nsuch considerations would be sufficient to lead to monetary unions, as the quote with which I began\nsuggests.) Political factors, rather than economic ones, have played the dominant role. The nations of\nEurope share a remarkable cultural heritage in philosophy, politics, science, religion, and the arts, and\nadvanced thinkers have long recognized that this common heritage might serve as a basis for the\nformation of a cohesive European political entity. Such an entity presumably could influence world\nevents and provide for a common defense more effectively than could a collection of nation-states.\nIndeed, political and economic integration within regions of Europe has occurred on a number of\noccasions - for example, in Germany and Italy. Another important motivation for political integration\nhas been the desire to reduce the risk of intra-European conflict. From Napoleon to Bismarck to the\nKaiser to Hitler, Franco-Prussian and then Franco-German conflicts were flash points for\ncontinentwide and worldwide wars. European economic and monetary union holds the promise of\nbinding so closely the economic interests of these two powers, as well as those of other European\nnations, as to make future intra-European conflict unthinkable. Such arguments have been part of the\ndebate over European integration at least since the 1957 Treaty of Rome. Indeed, the hope of\npolicymakers is to create a virtuous circle, in which closer economic integration promotes greater\npolitical cooperation, which enhances opportunities for economic integration, and so on.5\nThe largely political origin of the union has several implications for the economic analysis of the\ncommon currency. First, from a purely economic point of view, the creation of the European economic\nand monetary union is at least partly an exogenous event. Thus, we have something of a natural\nexperiment from which to learn about the effects of such institutional innovations. Second, we should\nkeep in mind that our assessment of the success of the euro, indeed of the entire experiment in\nEuropean integration, rests not only on economic criteria but also on the success of Europe as a\npolitical entity.\nIf we think of the introduction of the euro as representing to some degree a natural experiment in\nmonetary economics, what can we say about the costs and benefits, at least thus far, of this sweeping\ninstitutional change? We can look in a number of areas for effects of monetary unification, including\nthe patterns of trade, developments in the financial sector, changes in macroeconomic stability, and\nthe international role of the new currency. Many of these areas have already been examined today in\nmuch greater detail than I can do here. Rather than trying to be exhaustive, I will instead assert and\nbriefly defend a hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the most significant effects of monetary unification\nhave been felt, and will continue to be felt, in the development of European financial markets, and that\nthe greatest economic benefits to Europe in the long run will accrue through the improved functioning\nof these markets.\nTo defend this hypothesis, I need first to consider briefly the effects of monetary unification in some\nother key areas. Let us begin with trade. The debate about monetary unification was influenced to\nsome extent by a tradition of empirical research that provided some basis for optimism about the\neffects of a common currency on trade. For example, the extensive literature on so-called border\neffects concluded that nations trade with each other far less than would be expected based on the\nextent of trade between regions within a country, opening up the possibility that differing national\ncurrencies are among the factors that inhibit trade. In a recent study, Reuven Glick and Andrew Rose\n(2001) provided some support for the idea that currency unions promote trade. Glick and Rose\nanalyzed a panel data set of 217 countries for the period 1948 through 1997. They found that entering\nor leaving a currency union had large effects on trade flows; indeed, they estimated that a pair of\ncountries that begins to use a common currency should see a doubling in bilateral trade. However, as\nGlick and Rose themselves note, many of the countries entering or leaving currency unions during\ntheir sample period were small and poor, not rich and (in some cases) large like the nations of western\nEurope. Moreover, their analysis does not rule out either reverse causality (that is, that increasing\ntrade may promote the adoption of a currency union, rather than vice versa) or the possibility that a\nthird, unmeasured factor (such as political relationships) may have influenced both trade and currency\npolicies.\nIn contrast to the findings of Glick and Rose, evidence drawn directly from the recent European\nexperience does not generally support the view that adoption of a common currency has a major effect\non the magnitude or direction of trade.6 True, euro-area exports did surge after the adoption of the\neuro in January 1999. However, cyclical conditions and the early weakness of the new currency no\ndoubt played a critical role in that increase, an inference confirmed by the substantial slowing in\nEuropean export growth since the beginning of 2001. Also striking is the fact that the share of total\neuro-area exports destined for other members of the euro-zone did not increase with the introduction\nof the new currency, as would be likely if the common currency promoted trade. Indeed, at about\n50 percent of total exports, the intra-euro-area export share today remains noticeably below the recent\npeak of about 57 percent reached in the early 1990s.\nThe most decisive evidence on the trade question can be found by looking at microdata. In an\nimportant study, John Rogers (2003) of the Board staff analyzed annual data on the prices of\n139 items, collected by the Economist Intelligence Unit for twenty-five European and thirteen\nU.S. cities. For his main results, Rogers divided the items into traded and non-traded categories,\nthough he considered many other ways of slicing the data as well. He then analyzed the cross-city\ndispersion of prices in each year. Of course, the reduction of barriers to trade, the harmonization of tax\npolicies, and the increased efficiency of cross-national markets should lead to reduced dispersion in\nthe prices of goods, especially actively traded goods, as competition and arbitrage reduce local\nmonopoly power and differences in prices.\nRogers found a substantial decline in the dispersion of traded-goods prices across European cities\nover 1990-2001. Indeed, by the end of the period, the variability of traded goods prices across cities\nwithin EMU countries had declined by more than half, and it was not substantially different from the\nvariability found among cities in the United States. This convergence of prices suggests a powerful,\nongoing process of increased economic integration and elimination of barriers to trade among the\nmembers of the European Monetary Union. Crucially, however, Rogers found that the bulk of this\nconvergence occurred between 1990 and 1994, the period of the \"single market\" initiative. Only a\nsmall part of the convergence in traded goods prices occurred after 1998, the period during which the\neuro was introduced and national currencies were withdrawn from circulation. Rogers' evidence\ntherefore suggests that the increased integration of product markets in Europe has been an ongoing\nprocess, which may have been assisted by the adoption of the euro but for which a common currency\nhas hardly proved essential.\nA second question of interest is the degree to which adoption of the euro has affected macroeconomic\nstability in the euro zone. In Mundell's taxonomy, adoption of a common currency is a strictly negative\nfactor for stability because it eliminates the shock-absorbing features of flexible exchange rates and\nindependent monetary policies. In fact, however, the effects of the common currency on\nmacroeconomic stability in Europe have been positive as well as negative. Notably, the structure and\nmandate of the European Central Bank (ECB), as well as the perception of continuity with the policies\nof the pre-euro Bundesbank, have enhanced the ECB's credibility and contributed to low and stable\ninflation in the euro-zone. Although Germany and several other countries in the union enjoyed low\ninflation before the adoption of the common currency, with some partial exceptions to be discussed in\na moment, the ECB has been able to \"export\" that benefit to other members of the monetary union.\nThe common currency has also eliminated periodic exchange-rate crises, which had plagued\nEuropean monetary arrangements and generated real and financial disturbances at least since the\ndays of the gold standard.\nOn the other hand, the ECB has faced the challenge of making policy for Europe as a whole despite\ndiffering macroeconomic conditions in member countries, a dilemma that Mundell would have\npredicted. For example, since 1999 a few countries, such as Ireland, have had inflation rates\nconsistently above the euro-zone average. Irish inflation peaked at 7 percent on a twelve-month basis\nin November 2000 and has since been in the 4 to 5 percent range. At the same time, other countries,\nsuch as Germany, have experienced low - perhaps uncomfortably low - rates of inflation.7 Patrick\nHonohan and Philip Lane (2003) investigated the sources of relatively high inflation in Ireland after the\nadoption of the euro. These authors found that the loss of exchange-rate flexibility and monetary\nautonomy played important roles in the Irish inflation. For example, a relatively large share of Ireland's\ntrade is with non-European partners, so that the early weakness of the euro stimulated Irish exports\nand economic activity disproportionately. Ireland was also unable to resort to monetary restraint to\ncool down an economy that, for a variety of reasons, was experiencing faster demand growth than\nmost of the rest of Europe.8 Ireland's relatively high inflation rate may in turn have had destabilizing\neffects, because, in combination with low pan-European nominal interest rates, it implied that the Irish\neconomy faced a negative real rate of interest. One possible consequence of the low real rate is the\nboom in Irish property prices, which has fed back into higher domestic spending. Of course, at the\nother end of the spectrum, Germany has experienced weak growth and very low inflation in the past\nfew years (Sinn, 2003). Without the ability to use stabilizing monetary policy, Germany has eased\nfiscal policy and thus has come into conflict with its obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact.\nIn short, with respect to macroeconomic stability, the common currency appears to have had both\npositive and negative effects. More time will be needed before we can assess whether the common\ncurrency will ultimately be a stabilizing or a destabilizing influence at the macroeconomic level.\nYet a third area in which potential benefits of the euro have often been cited is in respect to the\ncommon currency's potential international role. The phrase \"international role of the euro\" covers a\nnumber of disparate possible functions of the currency. These functions include the use of\neurodenominated assets as official reserves, the use of the euro as a vehicle currency in foreign-exchange\ntransactions, the denomination in euros of financing instruments issued by borrowers not resident in\nthe euro zone, the acceptance of euro-denominated or euro-linked assets in international investment\nportfolios, and the invoicing in euros of internationally traded goods and services. Of course, during\nthe post-World War II period the U.S. dollar has been the dominant international currency with respect\nto each of these functions. It seems plausible that the euro, a low-inflation currency used by an\neconomy comparable to that of the United States in size and sophistication, will, over time, increase its\n\"market share\" in each of these areas. However, the euro's potential international role, and, more\nimportantly, the benefits to euro-zone countries of an increased role for the euro differ significantly by\nfunction.\nA summary evaluation of the euro's international position is that the common currency's role has been\nincreasing but that so far the euro has posed less of a challenge to the U.S. dollar as an international\nmedium of exchange than some analysts expected. For example, in foreign exchange markets the\nU.S. dollar accounts for nearly 50 percent of transaction \"sides,\" compared with about 25 percent for\nthe euro, implying that the overwhelming majority of foreign-exchange transactions involve the dollar\n(European Central Bank, 2003, p. 26; data are from Continuous Linked Settlement). Hence, the dollar\nappears to remain the international \"vehicle currency,\" serving as a temporary abode of value for\nforeign-exchange transactions involving third currencies, whereas the euro's role in foreign-exchange\nmarkets is similar to that played in earlier times by the deutschemark (Solans, 2003). The dollar also\nremains the dominant invoicing currency for internationally traded raw materials, such as oil. The\ndollar is even dominant in U.S.-European trade, with more than 90 percent of U.S. exports to Europe\nand something more than 80 percent of European exports to the United States being invoiced in\ndollars as of September 2003 (European Central Bank, 2003, p. 33). With regard to the currency\ncomposition of official reserves, dollar-denominated assets accounted for 64.5 percent of world\nreserves at the end of 2002, down from 67.5 percent at the end of 2000. During the same period, the\neuro's share of international reserves rose from 15.9 percent to 18.7 percent (European Central Bank,\n2003, p. 45).\nAlthough economists and financial market participants will observe the developing role of the euro in\ninternational transactions with interest, the direct benefits to euro-zone economies of having the euro\nplay an international medium-of-exchange role are relatively modest. Arguably, the more significant\naspects of the euro's international role arise from the strengthening and expansion of\neurodenominated financial markets as these markets take on a greater international character.\nInternationalization of European financial markets increases investment opportunities, opportunities for\ndiversification, and sources of funding and improves liquidity and market efficiency. On that note, let\nme turn finally to the effect of the common currency on European financial markets.\nAs I have already suggested, the most important benefit of the currency union has been and will likely\ncontinue to be its strengthening of European financial markets. Traditionally, the efficiency and scope\nof these markets has been hampered by the costs and risks associated with the use of multiple\ncurrencies as well as by the fragmentation arising from international differences in legal structure,\naccounting rules, and other institutions. Given the rapidity and frequency of trade in financial markets,\neven small transaction costs can hamper the efficiency and liquidity of those markets. The common\ncurrency, with ongoing efforts to harmonize financial regulations and institutions, has significantly\nreduced those transaction costs. Together with lower country-specific macro risks arising from the\nadoption of the common currency, this reduction in transaction costs has greatly improved the breadth\nand efficiency of European financial markets.\nImportantly, the benefit of more efficient financial markets goes well beyond the benefits to financial\ninvestors and the financial industry itself. A growing academic literature suggests that financial\ndevelopment is a critical precursor to broader economic development (King and Levine, 1993). In this\nvein, a study for the European Commission estimated that financial development that brought the\nEuropean financial system close to U.S. norms might add almost a percentage point to the growth of\nvalue added in manufacturing in the European Union (Giannetti et al., 2002). Whether one accepts\nthis optimistic assessment or not, there are evidently significant potential benefits to financial\ndeepening that go beyond the financial sector itself.\nHow has the common currency improved financial efficiency? Perhaps the most dramatic effects of the\nmonetary union in the financial sphere have been in fixed-income markets, both government and\nprivate. Government debt markets, because of their size, safety, and benchmark status, are central to\na vibrant fixed-income market, and they have been particularly strengthened by the adoption of the\neuro. Notably, since the run-up to monetary union began, sovereign debt yields have converged to a\nremarkable extent. For example, between 1990 and 1996, spreads on Italian and Spanish government\nbonds, relative to German bonds of comparable maturity, averaged about 430 and 350 basis points,\nrespectively. Today the spreads paid by these governments are quite small, in the vicinity of 15 basis\npoints over the German equivalent for Italy and essentially zero for Spain.9 Clearly, these governments\nhave benefited substantially by the reduction in inflation risk and exchange rate risk provided by the\ncommon currency.10 The addition of some sovereign default risk (now relevant because individual\ncountries are no longer able to inflate away their debts) has evidently not offset these benefits,\nperhaps because of the effects of the Stability and Growth Pact.\nBeyond improving the fundamentals of government finances, the common currency has also\nincreased the depth and breadth of government bond markets. In particular, the development of a\nlarge market in euro-denominated government debt and the resulting expansion in cross-border\nholdings of debt has improved market liquidity and opportunities for risk sharing. For example, in their\nexcellent survey of developments in European financial markets since the introduction of the euro,\nGabriele Galati and Kostas Tsatsaronis (2003, p. 174) note that nonresident holdings of French\ngovernment bonds rose from about 15 percent at the end of 1997 to about 35 percent by 2002.\nMoreover, as of 2002, foreigners held three-quarters of Belgian government long-term bonds and\n63 percent of Irish government debt. A broader investor clientele implies more potential bidders in\nprimary markets and more transactions in secondary markets, improving liquidity. This broadening is\nthe sense in which an international role for the euro, by which here I mean more internationalized\nEuropean financial markets, seems to promise the greatest potential benefits.\nThe European government bond market has been substantially strengthened by the adoption of the\ncommon currency, but it has not attained the liquidity of the U.S. Treasury market (and may never do\nso). Although aggregate issuance of euro-zone government debt is of the same order of magnitude as\nU.S. Treasury issues, there remains the fundamental difference that euro-zone debt is the debt of\ntwelve sovereign entities, rather than one as in the United States. Naturally, the Stability and Growth\nPact notwithstanding, the European Union accepts no collective responsibility for the debts of\nindividual governments. Moreover, so far coordination of issuance schedules, the structure of issues,\nand other technical details has been limited. However, opportunities for further strengthening of the\neuro-zone government bond market appear to remain. For example, if the technical details can be\nworked out, one can imagine the issuance of securities backed by the obligations of multiple European\ngovernments. These securities could be made uniform by fixing the country shares of the underlying\ndebt, or by stripping off country-specific default risks through such instruments as credit default swaps.\nSuch securities would provide a benchmark yield curve, among other advantages.\nThe benefits of the euro for government bond markets have carried over to corporate bond markets as\nwell. Issuance of euro-denominated bonds by corporations took off soon after the introduction of the\nnew currency. Although much of the boom no doubt reflected general macroeconomic conditions and\nother factors, potential access to a much larger base of investors willing to hold bonds in the common\ncurrency and resulting improvements in pricing and liquidity also played a role. Underwriting costs\nhave also fallen, the result of both greater competition and the reduced costs of bringing issues to\nmarket (Santos and Tsatsaronis, 2003). The rapid development of Europe's corporate bond market,\nincluding a nascent high-yield market, should prove highly beneficial to European economic\ndevelopment.\nThe benefits of the common currency for other types of securities markets have been more mixed thus\nfar, but the potential is there. The European interbank market was strengthened substantially in\ntandem with the creation of the Eurosystem of central banks. In contrast, markets for securities lending\n(repo markets) remain somewhat fragmented, and commercial paper markets are underdeveloped.\nEuropean stock markets, which in any case account for a smaller share of financing activity than in the\nUnited States, have not been successfully harmonized thus far, and cross-border equity investments\nmay still involve high transaction costs (McAndrews and Stefanadis, 2002). However, it is widely\nobserved that the perspectives and strategies of European equity analysts have changed, toward a\nde-emphasis on country-specific factors and greater attention to industry and company factors in the\nvaluation of stocks (Adjaouté and Danthine, 2002). This change indicates that financial market\nparticipants see increased financial and economic integration in Europe as an irreversible trend.\nEfforts to adhere to the Lamfalussy Process, which aims to streamline the harmonization process for\nfinancial market legislation and regulation, should hasten the integration of European securities\nmarkets.\nEuropean finance has traditionally been bank-centered. What will happen to banks in the new regime?\nBanks may lose some loan customers to the growing securities markets, but they will also benefit from\nincreased access to finance, both in the interbank market and in the corporate bond market. Indeed,\nthe banks were large players in the early boom in the issuance of euro-denominated corporate bonds,\naccounting for more than half the new issues thus far (Galati and Tsatsaronis, 2003, p. 181). On the\nlending side, banks' local knowledge and specialized services should allow them to retain an important\nmarket share. In a study that illustrated the importance of banks' knowledge of local conditions, Allen\nBerger and David Smith (2003) found that European affiliates of multinational corporations strongly\nprefer working with a bank in the country of their operation, rather than a bank from the country of the\nmultinational's corporate headquarters. Moreover, having chosen a bank in the country of operations,\nthe affiliates were more likely to select a bank with local or regional operations than a bank with global\nreach. These results are consistent with the view that bankers' competitive advantage relative to\nsecurity markets is their knowledge of local firms, markets, and economic conditions and their ability to\nestablish long-term relationships with local customers. Perhaps the European banking situation will\nbegin to look more like that of the United States, where borrowing through securities issuance and\nbanking co-exist, providing different services and meeting the needs of different clienteles. Moreover,\nthe composition of banks may settle into the pattern of the United States, where very large banks with\na global reach and the capacity to engineer highly complex transactions and community banks that\nspecialize in lending to the local area have both found room to flourish. However banking may evolve\nin Europe, increased financial integration that makes local banking markets more \"contestable\" will\nlikely improve the efficiency with which local banking services are delivered.\nMy remarks this evening have only scratched the surface of a large topic, but it seems safe to\nconclude that the common currency has had and will continue to have large benefits for European\nfinance. At a minimum, the single currency eliminates exchange-rate risks that exist when securities\nare denominated in different currencies. The single unit of account seems also likely to reduce\ntransaction costs and eliminate a portion of the fixed costs involved in issuing similar securities in\nmultiple currencies. These factors are already serving to moderate home bias in borrowing and\nlending, leading to larger, more-liquid, and more-diversified financial markets.\nClearly, a great deal more work needs to be done, both by the government and by the private sector,\nto realize the full benefits of the common currency for European finance. Beyond the markets that I\nhave mentioned as needing special attention, like equity markets, further harmonization is also\nrequired to coordinate national systems for payments, clearing, and settlement. A larger and more\nintegrated financial system may carry greater systemic risks and raise new challenges for the system\nof financial oversight and supervision. Further challenges will arise as new countries, including those\ncurrently at a relatively low level of financial development, join the European monetary system. Their\naccession will greatly complicate the harmonization process, but given what we know about the role of\nfinance in economic development, the benefits for both the new members and the current ones could\nbe very large.",

         "Susan Schmidt Bies: The economic outlook and the state of household and\nbusiness finances\nRemarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, before the New York Forecasters Club, New York, 26 February 2004.\n* * *\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today. As a relative newcomer to the forecasting profession, I must say\nthat speaking to such an esteemed group of professional prognosticators is a bit intimidating. But\nnewcomers often bring new perspectives, and I hope my remarks will prove informative. I intend to talk\nbriefly about my assessment of the economic outlook and then turn to a more detailed discussion of\nhow the evolution of household and business balance sheets in recent years is affecting economic\nactivity.1\nThe Economic outlook\nAs you know, real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 6 percent in the second half of\n2003, and the economic fundamentals seem to be in place for another sizable advance this year.\nIndeed, the GDP forecasts of Federal Open Market Committee members have a central tendency\nrange of 4-1/2 to 5 percent. Yet despite the recent strong pace of economic activity, the labor market\nhas improved only slowly. I am cautiously optimistic, however, that job growth will pick up - perhaps\nsubstantially - over the course of this year. My business contacts tell me that companies have indeed\nbecome more optimistic about economic prospects and that their plans include some increase in the\nsize of their payrolls. The FOMC expects the unemployment rate to fall to between 5-1/4 and\n5-1/2 percent by the end of this year.\nAlthough economic growth revived in the second half of 2003, core consumer price inflation continued\nto slow. Surveys suggest that inflation expectations remain stable, and extraordinary gains in labor\nproductivity have continued to keep price pressures in check. Moreover, I expect these recent\nfavorable price trends to continue, and I am very comfortable with the FOMC's prediction of a\n1 percent to 1-1/4 percent rise in the PCE price index this year - a shade less than the increase in\n2003.\nBriefly putting on my hat as a monetary policy maker, I will say that the prospect of a strongly growing\neconomy, falling unemployment, and low inflation seems to be close to a central banker's ideal. Under\nthese conditions, we can be patient before we must, inevitably, confront the need to diminish the\nsubstantial degree of monetary accommodation now in place.\nGiven this broad-brush summary of the outlook, let me now take a closer look at the financial positions\nof U.S. households and businesses. As I will discuss, the favorable financial conditions in both sectors\nshould support a solid increase in household and business expenditures.\nHousehold financial conditions\nSome commentators have expressed concern about the rapid growth in household debt in recent\nyears. They fear that households have become overextended and will need to rein in their spending to\nkeep their debt burdens under control. My view, however, is considerably more sanguine. Although\nthere are pockets of financial stress among households, the sector as a whole appears to be in good\nshape.\nCertainly, households have taken on quite a bit of debt over the past several years. According to the\nlatest available data, total household debt grew at an annual rate of 10 percent between the end of\n1999 and the third quarter of 2003; in comparison, after-tax household income increased at a rate of\n6 percent. The rapid growth in household debt largely reflects a surge in mortgage borrowing, which\nhas been fueled by historically low mortgage interest rates and strong growth in house prices.\nDespite the heavy borrowing, households have kept the repayment burden of their debt in check.\nNotably, many homeowners have taken advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages,\nsome having done so several times over the past couple of years. Survey data suggest that\nhomeowners took out cash in more than one-third of these \"refis,\" often to pay down loans with higher\ninterest rates. The resulting drop in the average interest rate on household debt, combined with the\nlengthening maturity of this debt, has tempered the repayment obligation from the growing stock of\ndebt.\nThe Federal Reserve publishes two series that quantify this repayment obligation. The first series, the\ndebt service ratio, measures the required payments on mortgage and consumer debt as a share of\nafter-tax personal income. The second series, the financial obligations ratio, is a broader version of the\ndebt service ratio that includes required household payments on rent, auto leases, homeowners'\ninsurance, and property taxes. Both ratios rose during the 1990s, and both reached a peak in late\n2001. Since then, however, they have receded slightly on net from their respective peaks, an\nindication that households, in the aggregate, have been keeping an eye on repayment burdens.\nBecause the debt service ratio and the financial obligations ratio are calculated from aggregate data,\nthey do not necessarily indicate whether the typical household is experiencing financial stress.\nNonetheless, we have found that changes in either ratio help predict future changes in consumer loan\ndelinquencies. Accordingly, the fact that these ratios have come off their recent peaks is a hopeful sign\nabout household loan performance. Indeed, delinquency rates for a wide range of household loans\nturned down over the second half of 2003.\nAnother often-cited indicator of household financial conditions is the personal bankruptcy rate.\nMovements in the bankruptcy rate, to be sure, partly reflect changes in the incidence of financial\nstress, but the rate has been trending up for more than two decades for a variety of other reasons. The\nBankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 made bankruptcy a more attractive option for most households by\nincreasing the amount of wealth that households could retain after bankruptcy. Other factors that have\nlikely contributed to the upward trend are the decrease in the social stigma of filing for bankruptcy and\nthe growing access to credit in the United States. As lenders have become more sophisticated in their\nability to assess the riskiness of borrowers, they have extended loans to households that were\npreviously denied credit. These households are more likely to default on their obligations than the\ntypical borrower, but this increased risk is priced into loan terms. Although the bankruptcy rate remains\nelevated, it has edged down on balance in recent months, likely because of the pickup in economic\ngrowth in the United States since mid-2003.\nThis relatively upbeat assessment of household credit quality seems to be shared by lenders and by\ninvestors in securities backed by consumer debt. According to the Federal Reserve's survey of senior\nloan officers, banks have not materially changed their lending policies for consumer loans over the\npast couple of years. This behavior certainly does not point to much concern about household loan\nperformance. Moreover, one gets an even more positive message from the credit spreads on\nsecurities backed by auto loans and credit card receivables. In recent months, the spreads between\nthe yields on these securities and swap rates of comparable maturities have narrowed across the\ncredit spectrum.\nThus far, I have focused on the liability side of the household balance sheet, but there have been\nfavorable developments on the asset side as well. Equity prices rallied strongly last year and have\ncontinued to rise this year, reversing a good chunk of the losses sustained over the previous three\nyears. In addition, home prices appreciated sharply during each year from 1997 to 2002. Although the\nincreases in home prices have slowed somewhat lately, the cumulative rise since the late 1990s has\nexceeded the growth in per capita income by a wide margin. All told, the ratio of household net worth\nto disposable income - a useful summary of the sector's financial position - recovered last year to\nstand at a level slightly above its long-term average.\nBefore I turn to the business sector, let me address two concerns that have been voiced about the\nprospects for households. The first of these regards the low level of the personal saving rate. During\nthe past several years, the personal saving rate has been in the neighborhood of 2 percent, well below\nits earlier post-World War II average of nearly 8 percent. Such low personal savings rates raise\nconcerns that households may not be saving enough to meet longer-run needs, such as for retirement\nor college education of their children.\nWhat might be behind this paucity of personal saving? As recently as the early 1990s, the saving rate\nwas near its long-run average. One reason that the saving rate fell during the 1990s was the rising\nstock market. Higher equity prices led consumers to feel wealthier, which boosted spending relative to\nincome and thus reduced the saving rate. In addition, the greater household wealth brought about by\nhigher equity prices meant that any saving goals a family might have - such as for education or\nretirement - were closer to being fulfilled. Hence, households would need to save less to achieve those\ngoals.\nBy this logic, we might have expected to see some increase in the saving rate in the aftermath of the\nsharp declines in equity prices in 2000, 2001, and 2002. It is true, as I noted earlier, that rising house\nprices cushioned these losses. But, on net, household wealth took a hit during these years without any\ncommensurate rise in the saving rate.\nA key factor that has likely boosted spending - and thus held down saving - has been the low level of\ninterest rates. The low interest rates have worked directly by stimulating spending in interest-sensitive\nsectors such as consumer durable goods. In addition, they have facilitated the restructuring of the\nhousehold sector's balance sheet, with a positive indirect effect on expenditures. In particular, over the\npast few years, homeowners have extracted a large amount of home equity through cash-out\nrefinancing and home sales, which helped to support consumption despite the decline in equity prices.\nAs I noted earlier, I do not think that the household sector is overextended, and thus I do not believe\nthat a large, autonomous increase in the personal saving rate is a serious risk to the economy.\nHowever, I would not be surprised to see the personal saving rate move up gradually over time to\nlevels more consistent with its historical average. This rise presumably would be consistent with the\nexpected shift in the pattern of growth in our economy - from an expansion that has been led mainly by\nthe household sector to one led more by business spending.\nThe second concern often expressed is that a bubble may have developed in house prices after\nseveral years of rapid increases. Some of the measured price rise results from improvements in the\nquality of houses: Houses are bigger and have more amenities than in the past, two characteristics\nthat will lead to rising average house prices over time. But even after controlling for quality, increases\nin home prices have been outstripping general price inflation by a considerable margin in recent years.\nOnce again, the low interest rates are probably an important factor. Houses, like other assets,\ngenerate an expected stream of future benefits. With low interest rates, these future benefits are\ndiscounted less heavily, which raises the asset's price today. Low interest rates also push up house\nprices by boosting the demand for housing. Of course, some of that increased demand is being met by\nthe rapid pace of construction of new housing. But building houses takes time, and in the interim,\nhigher demand will push up the price of existing houses.\nAlthough we can identify the key forces behind the rise in house prices in recent years, we cannot be\nsure that the increases are fully justified by the prevailing fundamentals. Still, we need to keep the\nrecent increases in house prices in perspective: Although house prices have been outstripping broad\nmeasures of inflation - even after adjusting for quality improvements - their rise is nothing like the\nincrease in equity prices in the late 1990s.\nIn fact, the speculative forces that can sometimes drive equity prices to extremes are less likely to\nemerge in housing prices. First, buying and selling houses is a lot more expensive and cumbersome\nthan buying and selling equities, which makes taking a speculative position in houses much more\ndifficult. Second, housing markets are much more local than equity markets, which are national, if not\nglobal, in scope. So if any speculative frenzy emerged, it would be much less likely to spread in the\nhousing markets than in equity markets. Finally, financial institutions have a much more disciplined\nprocess around the housing and construction lending market than they did in past housing cycles.\nLenders today are cautious about lending for speculative purposes, and appraised values undergo\nmore scrutiny than in the past. The expansion of credit to higher risk households may also have driven\nbanks to strengthen their underwriting procedures.\nThat said, it is certainly possible for local housing markets to become overvalued and then to\nexperience sharp price declines. House prices fell significantly in several parts of the country in the\nearly 1990s. But because the transactions costs are much higher in the housing market than in the\nequity market, and because the underlying demand for living space is much more predictable than are\nthe prospects for any given firm, the large rises and declines often observed in the stock market are\nless likely to occur in the market for houses. In addition, lenders are much more responsive to local\neconomic conditions, and generally become more cautious in loan underwriting when unsold homes or\nlocal unemployment increase.\nFinancial conditions of businesses\nThe change in the economy that caught my attention in the second half of 2003 was that the decline in\nbusiness fixed investment had finally ceased. Capital spending by businesses posted a solid increase\nin the second half of last year, and orders for nondefense capital goods - a key indicator of equipment\nspending - point to further sizable gains. Moreover, the tenor of anecdotes from the corporate sector\nhas become comparatively upbeat, with corporate managers seeing stronger revenue growth and a\nmuch improved and accommodative financing environment.\nFour important factors have contributed to this improvement in financial conditions: low interest rates,\na widespread restructuring of corporate liabilities during the past few years, a sharp rebound in\ncorporate profitability from its trough in 2001, and a substantial narrowing in market risk premiums. In\naddition, the burden of underfunded pension plans, perhaps the most prominent negative financial\nfactor that remains, has eased of late. I will discuss each factor in turn.\nFirst, firms are continuing to benefit from the accommodative stance of monetary policy. With the\nfederal funds rate at 1 percent, short-term borrowing costs remain very low. For longer-term debt, the\ncombination of low yields on benchmark Treasury securities and reduced risk spreads has kept\nborrowing costs attractive. Indeed, the yield on Moody's Baa corporate bond index is at its lowest\nsustained level since 1968.\nSecond, in response to low long-term rates and to nervous investors who were burned by some\nhighprofile, unanticipated meltdowns, firms have greatly strengthened their balance sheets. Many firms\nhave refinanced high-cost debt, which has reduced the average interest rate on the debt of\nnonfinancial corporations more than 1 percentage point since the end of 2000. The average cost of\nservicing debt would have fallen even further if not for a second major trend - the extension of debt\nmaturities. Businesses replaced a substantial portion of their short-maturity debt with long-maturity\ndebt, both to lock in low rates and to improve their ability to withstand a liquidity shock (since long-term\ndebt does not need to be continually rolled over). In addition, many firms - especially in the most\ntroubled industries - have retired debt through equity offerings and asset sales, which limited the\ngrowth of nonfinancial corporate debt in 2002 and 2003 to the slowest pace since the early 1990s.\nThird, firms have significantly tightened their belts. Over the past two years, the drive to cut costs has\ngenerated rapid productivity gains. This greater efficiency boosted corporate profitability in 2002 and\n2003 despite rather tepid revenue growth. Moreover, a pickup in revenue growth in the second half of\nlast year helped companies leverage those productivity gains, producing a dramatic recovery in overall\ncorporate profitability. Over the course of 2003, operating earnings at S&P 500 corporations surged\nalmost 25 percent, bringing profit margins to their highest levels in several years.\nFourth, risk premiums fell substantially last year as corporate governance scandals receded and\ninvestor sentiment turned markedly more positive. The recovery in stock prices reflects this brighter\nview. In addition, spreads on corporate bonds have narrowed appreciably - especially for the riskiest\nfirms - and they now stand at the lowest levels in several years. This decline in spreads has been\nhelped along by the beneficial effect of the balance sheet improvements that I mentioned a moment\nago. Indicators of corporate financial stress such as bond rating downgrades and default rates have\nreturned to levels normally associated with economic expansion. Delinquency rates on business loans\nat commercial banks have also declined, and our surveys indicate that, on balance, banks have\nrecently eased the terms and standards on such loans.\nIn another sign of improved sentiment, money has been flowing into riskier securities. For example,\nequity mutual funds have registered strong net inflows for nearly a year, as have high-yield bond\nfunds. The more favorable tone in the bond market has been associated with a notable pickup in\njunkbond deals amid a surge of corporate bond issues. Over the past two quarters, the market for initial\npublic equity offerings has also come back to life; investors appear to be increasingly receptive to new\nissues, though (fortunately) they still appear to be more selective than during the boom in the late\n1990s.\nThese four points all suggest that financial conditions are capable of supporting a sustained, healthy\npickup in economic growth. The much improved profitability can help finance expansion directly out of\ninternal funds or indirectly by supporting firms' borrowing capacity. Furthermore, firms will be able to\ndraw on their liquid assets that have accumulated over the past couple of years. And given the\nsuccessful efforts to pare costs, firms are set to benefit from new investment in plant and equipment.\nPerhaps the biggest hurdle still facing many corporations is the burden of underfunding in their\ndefined-benefit (DB) pension plans, but even here we have seen some improvement from the situation\na year ago. At that time, the value of pension assets had been significantly eroded by stock market\nlosses, and sharply declining interest rates had raised the present value of plan liabilities. Just among\nthe firms in the S&P 500, the combined effect was to subtract nearly half a trillion dollars from the net\nasset value of DB pension plans during 2000, 2001, and 2002. As a result, 90 percent of\nS&P 500 plans were underfunded at the end of 2002, with a net shortfall that exceeded more than\n$200 billion. Most companies with DB plans thus needed to make additional contributions to their\npension plans, in some cases quite substantial contributions. For many, this situation was a sea\nchange from the multiyear contribution holiday they experienced during the 1990s.\nIndeed, in 2002, S&P 500 firms contributed $46 billion to their pension plans - three times more than in\neither of the previous two years - and total contributions are estimated to have been even higher in\n2003. But this drain on cash resources is likely to decline, or at least not worsen, over the next few\nyears. DB pension assets have benefited from robust returns in equity markets since early last year,\nand pension liabilities are estimated to have risen only modestly in 2003. Automakers, in particular,\nhave already bitten the bullet; together with the solid returns earned on plan assets last year, their\ncash contributions have apparently helped to wipe out much of their funding deficit.\nSo what is the longer-term prognosis for firms with DB pensions? Assuming current discount rates and\nnormal pension asset returns, S&P 500 firms would eventually need to make about $150 billion in\ncontributions to close the remaining funding gap. And once the current funding hole is filled, these\nfirms would still need to make contributions to cover their rising liabilities. Indeed, DB plans are\nincreasingly concentrated in mature industries with aging workforces, for which the growth rate of\nliabilities is relatively high and rising. This longer-term challenge will remain even if the current\nfavorable market conditions are sustained.\nConclusion\nIn summary, recent indicators suggest that the pace of economic activity remains solid, while\ninflationary pressures continue to be subdued. In addition, the household and business sectors are, by\nand large, in good financial shape. Although uncertainties remain, I believe the fundamentals are in\nplace to generate sustainable economic growth.",

         "Alan Greenspan: Intellectual property rights\nRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research Economic Summit, Stanford,\nCalifornia, 27 February 2004.\n* * *\nMarket economies require a rule of law. A society without state protection of individual rights,\nespecially the right to own property, would not build private long-term assets, a key ingredient of a\ngrowing modern economy.\nSince its early stirrings in eighteenth-century Britain, modern economic development has been\ncharacterized by an ebb and flow in the intensity of state involvement in shaping the economic\nenvironment. According to the legends of the early American West, the only law west of the Pecos\nRiver was administered by Judge Bean. I am not sure how much law that was, but I do know that\nmuch protection of property in sparsely settled western communities just after the Civil War had to be\nprivately provided. Understandably, trade was limited in such an environment. Economic growth was\ngreatly facilitated by the emergence of civil government, which provided, among other things,\nconsistent and predictable enforcement of property rights.\nMore recently, the states of the former Soviet Union suffered for a time many of the alleged\ncharacteristics of the American Wild West-legal chaos, rampant criminality, and widespread\ncorruption. This difficult period of transition in the Soviet satellite countries followed four decades of\ncentral planning in which the arbitrary enforcement of an inefficient set of rules resulted in massive\neconomic failure. With few exceptions, the new leaders of these countries recognize that their future\neconomic success will depend on an efficient and predictable rule of law.\n* * *\nA tension has always existed between a desired continuity in the laws and regulations governing trade\nand business practices and the necessary updating that is required to keep pace with a growing and,\nhence, changing economy. Uncertainties that stem from the arbitrary enforcement of the body of\nprevailing rules result in higher risk and an associated elevation of the cost of capital, which in turn\ninhibits economic growth.\nImplementing an effective rule of law, however, has its own difficulties. One key component, a law of\ncontracts, governs the resolution of certain disputes between parties. Yet if adjudication were\nrequested for more than a very small fraction of contracts, our court system would be swamped into\nimmobility and the performance of our economy would suffer. Thus, if our market system is to function\nsmoothly, the vast majority of trades must rest on mutual trust and only indirectly on the law.\nA more general concern is that laws can never be fixed in perpetuity. As societies and economies\nevolve, the details of the law, though generally not its fundamental principles, need to change. But any\nuncertainty about the clarity and fixity of the law adds to the risk of trade, which as I noted, is reflected\nin a higher real cost of capital.\nWe in the United States endeavored to lessen legal uncertainty by embedding our most fundamental\nprinciples in a constitution, which we made difficult to amend. The commercially and economically\nsalient specifics are typically expressed in federal or state statutes. In general, this arrangement\nseems to have provided us with a healthy balance of continuity and predictability and, yet, also the\nrequisite flexibility to respond to evolving economic and societal circumstances.\n* * *\nReflecting that flexibility, the direction and the emphasis of legislative revision over the generations\nhave mirrored the changing structure of our economy. In recent decades, for example, the fraction of\nthe total output of our economy that is essentially conceptual rather than physical has been rising. This\ntrend has, of necessity, shifted the emphasis in asset valuation from physical property to intellectual\nproperty and to the legal rights inherent in intellectual property. Though the shift may appear glacial, its\nimpact on legal and economic risk is beginning to be felt.\nOver the past half-century, the increase in the value of raw materials has accounted for only a fraction\nof the overall growth of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). The rest of that growth reflects the\nembodiment of ideas in products and services that consumers value. This shift of emphasis from\nphysical materials to ideas as the core of value creation appears to have accelerated in recent\ndecades.\nTechnological advance is continually altering the shape and nature of our economic processes and, in\nparticular, is promoting the trend toward increasing conceptualization of U.S. GDP. The size of our\nradios, for example, has been dramatically reduced by the substitution of transistors for vacuum tubes.\nThin fiber optic cable has replaced huge tonnages of copper wire. New architectural, engineering, and\nmaterials technologies have enabled the construction of buildings enclosing the same space with far\nless physical material than was required, say, 50 or 100 years ago. More recently, mobile phones\nhave markedly downsized as they have improved. The movement over the decades toward production\nof services requiring little physical input has also been a major contributor to the marked rise in the\nratio of constant dollars of GDP to ton of input.\nThis dramatic shift toward product downsizing during the past half-century stems from several causes.\nThe challenge of accumulating physical goods and moving them in an ever more crowded\ngeographical environment has clearly resulted in cost pressures to economize on size and space.\nSimilarly, the prospect of increasing costs of discovering, developing, and processing ever-larger\nquantities of physical resources has shifted producers toward downsized alternatives. This shift\nappears effectively to have answered the dire concerns that were expressed, in a report from the Club\nof Rome three decades ago, about the prospects of running out of the physical resources that\nallegedly were necessary to support our standards of living. Another cause of product downsizing is\nthat, as we moved the technological frontier forward and pressed for information processing to speed\nup, the laws of physics required the relevant microchips to become ever more compact.\nMore generally, in the realm of physical production, where scarce resources are critical inputs, each\nadditional unit of output is usually more costly to produce than the previous one; that is, production, at\nleast eventually, is characterized by increasing marginal cost. By contrast, in the realm of conceptual\noutput, much of production is characterized by constant, and perhaps even zero, marginal cost.\nFor example, though the set-up cost of creating an on-line encyclopedia may be enormous, the cost of\nreproduction and distribution may be near zero if the means of distribution is the Internet. The\nemergence of an electronic platform for the transmission of ideas at negligible marginal cost may,\ntherefore, be an important factor explaining the recent increased conceptualization of the GDP. The\ndemand for conceptual products is clearly impeded to a much smaller degree by rising marginal cost\nthan is the demand for physical products.\nBut regardless of its causes, conceptualization is irreversibly increasing the emphasis on the\nprotection of intellectual, relative to physical, property rights. Before World War I, markets in this\ncountry were essentially uninhibited by government regulations, but they were supported by rights to\nproperty, which in those years largely meant physical property. Intellectual property - patents,\ncopyrights, and trademarks - represented a far less important component of the economy, which was\nmainly agricultural. One of the most significant inventions of the nineteenth century was the cotton gin.\nPerhaps it was a harbinger of things to come that the intellectual-property content of the cotton gin\nwas never effectively protected from copiers.\nOnly in recent decades, as the economic product of the United States has become so predominantly\nconceptual, have issues related to the protection of intellectual property rights come to be seen as\nsignificant sources of legal and business uncertainty. In part, this uncertainty derives from the fact that\nintellectual property is importantly different from physical property. Because they have a material\nexistence, physical assets are more capable of being defended by police, the militia, or private\nmercenaries. By contrast, intellectual property can be stolen by an act as simple as broadcasting an\nidea without the permission of the originator. Moreover, one individual's use of an idea does not make\nthat idea unavailable to others for their own simultaneous use. Even more importantly, new ideas - the\nbuilding blocks of intellectual property - almost invariably build on old ideas in ways that are difficult or\nimpossible to trace. From an economic perspective, this provides a rationale for making calculus,\ndeveloped initially by Leibnitz and Newton, freely available, despite the fact that those insights have\nimmeasurably increased wealth over the generations. Should we have protected their claim in the\nsame way that we do for owners of land? Or should the law make their insights more freely available\nto those who would build on them, with the aim of maximizing the wealth of the society as a whole?\nAre all property rights inalienable, or must they conform to a reality that conditions them?\nThese questions bedevil economists and jurists, for they touch on some fundamental principles\ngoverning the organization of a modern economy and, hence, its society. Whether we protect\nintellectual property as an inalienable right or as a privilege vouchsafed by the sovereign, such\nprotection inevitably entails making some choices that have crucial implications for the balance we\nstrike between the interests of those who innovate and those who would benefit from innovation.\nIn the case of physical property, we take it for granted that the ownership right should have the\npotential of persisting as long as the physical object itself. In the case of an idea, however, we have\nchosen to strike a different balance in recognition of the chaos that could follow from having to trace\nback all the thoughts implicit in one's current undertaking and pay a royalty to the originator of each\none. So rather than adopting that principled but obviously unworkable approach, we have chosen\ninstead to follow the lead of British common law and place time limits on intellectual property rights.\nIt is, thus, no surprise that, as a result of the increasing conceptualization of our GDP over the\ndecades, the protection of intellectual property has become an important element in the ongoing\ndeliberations of both economists and jurists.\nOf particular current relevance to our economy overall is the application of property right protection to\ninformation technology. A noticeable component of the surge in the trend growth of the economy in\nrecent years arguably reflects the benefits that we have derived from the synergy of laser and fiber\noptic technologies in the 1960s and 1970s. This synergy has produced very little that is tangible in\ninformation technology. Yet the information flow that it facilitates has fostered the creation of vast\namounts of wealth. The dramatic gains in information technology have markedly improved the ability of\nbusinesses to identify and address incipient economic imbalances before they inflict significant\ndamage. These gains reflect new advances in both the physical and the conceptual realms. It is\nimperative to find the appropriate intellectual property regime for each.\n* * *\nIf our objective is to maximize economic growth, are we striking the right balance in our protection of\nintellectual property rights? Are the protections sufficiently broad to encourage innovation but not so\nbroad as to shut down follow-on innovation? Are such protections so vague that they produce\nuncertainties that raise risk premiums and the cost of capital? How appropriate is our current system\n- developed for a world in which physical assets predominated - for an economy in which value\nincreasingly is embodied in ideas rather than tangible capital? The importance of such questions is\nperhaps most readily appreciated here in Silicon Valley. Rationalizing the differences between\nintellectual property rights as defined and enforced in the United States and those of our trading\npartners has emerged as a seminal issue in our trade negotiations.\nIf the form of protection afforded to intellectual property rights affects economic growth, it must do so\nby increasing the underlying pace of output per labor hour, our measure of productivity growth. Ideas\nare at the center of productivity growth. Multifactor productivity by definition attempts to capture\nproduct innovations and insights in the way that capital and labor are organized to produce output.\nIdeas are also embodied directly in the capital that we employ. In essence, the growth of productivity\nattributable to factors other than indigenous natural resources and labor skill, is largely a measure of\nthe contribution of ideas to economic growth and to our standards of living.\nUnderstanding the interplay of ideas and economic growth should be an area of active economic\nanalysis, which for so many generations has focused mainly on physical things. This work will not be\neasy. Even as straightforward an issue as isolating the effect of the length of patents on overall\neconomic growth, a prominent issue recently before our Supreme Court, poses obvious formidable\nchallenges. Still, we must begin the important work of developing a framework capable of analyzing\nthe growth of an economy increasingly dominated by conceptual products.",

         "Mark W Olson: US Banking industry performance highlights - 2003\nSpeech by Mr Mark W Olson, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System,\nat the Annual Conference of the Institute of International Bankers, Washington, 1 March 2004.\n* * *\nThe banking industry enjoyed a very good year in 2003, one in which banks were able to adapt to a\nchanging environment and still generate record profits. Several factors contributed to this favorable\nsetting: low interest rates, a boom in mortgage banking and deposit-gathering, and favorable trends in\nmarket-sensitive businesses as the year went on.\nWe are just getting our first look at year-end financial information from Call Reports. Although the\nfigures are still preliminary, there are some interesting findings. In 2003, for the first time, insured\ncommercial banks earned $100 billion dollars. These impressive profits were 14 percent higher than in\n2002, which to that point was itself a record year for earnings. The industry's return on assets was\nalmost 1.40 percent, and its return on equity was 15.3 percent.\nThe level of earnings, even at $100 billion, may not be the most remarkable aspect of the industry's\n2003 results. The industry not only earned record profits but, as the year progressed, changed the way\nthey earned these profits. In other words, the industry adapted to changes in the business and\neconomic environment and did well.\nChanges really began over the summer, when mortgage originations began to taper off as longer-term\ninterest rates rose. For eight large bank holding companies with major mortgage banking operations,\nthe collective mortgage loan origination volume fell 50 percent to about $200 billion in the fourth\nquarter. This rate of decline parallels what other market sources indicate. Naturally, the fees\nassociated with these originations declined as well, although not as much as one might have\nexpected. Mortgage originations of $200 billion were still strong for these institutions by historical\nstandards, and income was aided by favorable developments in mortgage servicing, namely the\naccumulated buildup of servicing portfolios from the surge in mortgage lending and the revaluation of\nservicing assets due to slower prepayments.\nNet interest margins had been narrowing rather steadily since early 2002. A couple of things appeared\nto be at work. Typically, margin pressure tends to arise at banks facing stiff competitive pressure on\nloan yields and funding costs, perhaps an escalation in funding costs at banks experiencing rapid\nasset growth. The current situation is not a typical or normal environment.\nThe low-interest rate environment had a lot more to do with this narrowing, along with sluggish loan\ndemand. Historically low interest rates have significantly reduced the yields banks earn on their\nassets, especially mortgages. Banks built up their holdings of mortgages as market conditions\ngenerated such remarkable volumes of these loans, and as weak demand for commercial loans left a\nvoid in bank balance sheets and income. Historically low rates on new mortgage loans, together with\nrapid prepayment of higher-rate mortgages, have sharply reduced yields on bank mortgage portfolios.\nThe preliminary data for 2003 indicate that the effective yield on mortgage-backed securities, including\nadjustable-rate products, fell to 4.22 percent; by late in the year, yields had fallen to only about\n3.90 percent.\nAlong with this pressure on yields, banks have faced an interesting new pressure on funding costs.\nFor much of the last two years, households have been inclined to keep their assets very liquid and\nflexible. Interest rates have been low by historical terms, and didn't seem to provide much incentive for\nhouseholds to tie up their assets in time deposits. The stock market - at least through the spring of last\nyear - was on a downward track and certainly not providing attractive returns. Flexible bank deposits\noffered a comfortable compromise, providing positive returns, deposit insurance, and flexibility to\nredeploy funds if alternative investments became more attractive.\nIn this setting, bankers have valued core deposits even more highly, and have paid up for them. In\nparticular, they have favored nonmaturity deposits such as money market or savings accounts.\nSmaller-denomination certificates of deposit, in contrast, have declined steadily over a period of some\nyears. Influenced by the low interest rate environment, banks reduced the rates on their nonmaturity\ndeposits by far less than money market rates had fallen. The result has been tighter margins, but with\nan important potential side benefit. The success that bankers had in raising these nonmaturity\ndeposits created opportunities to reclaim some of the market share that bank deposits had lost over\nthe previous decade or two. Money market and savings accounts, in particular, now fund 30 percent of\nbank assets.\nRemarkably, despite these pressures, it now appears that bank margins recovered to some degree\nlate in 2003. The improvement was only about six basis points, but appears to be significantly\ninfluenced by slower prepayments and the resulting increases in mortgage asset yields. There were a\nhost of other forces at work, suggesting that the improvement in margins may or may not be\nsustainable. Still, banks were able to turn around their shrinking margins.\nPerhaps the biggest contributor to strong earnings has been steady improvement in asset quality\n- consistent with a gradually improving economy - that allowed for lower charge-offs and lower\nprovisions. By the end of 2003, problem assets had fallen to 0.94 percent of loans, down considerably\nfrom the peak level for this credit cycle of 1.27 percent in September 2002. Improvement in economic\nconditions is a key reason for the sustained decline, along with the liquidity and depth of secondary\nmarkets for troubled loans. We also think that better risk management - in particular, better\ndiversification - contributed to this decline. With charge-offs and problem assets declining for more\nthan a year, credit quality is on track to improve further, more so as the economy improves. As a\nresult, we can expect that banks will be able to take their provisions still lower and maybe their\nreserves as well.\nOne area in which bank profits lost ground was securities gains. Low interest rates had increased the\nmarket value of bank securities holdings, creating the opportunity for banks to sell these securities and\ntake the resulting gains into income. Booking such gains significantly enhanced near-term profits, but\nof course at the price of lowering future net interest earnings. In any case, increases in longer-term\ninterest rates over the summer meant that the opportunities for securities gains-taking faded. So did\nthe current contribution to earnings from securities gains.\nBanks still have not seen significant relief from weak business loan demand. In this business cycle,\nfirms have been reluctant to borrow - in part because of uncertainty about future prospects. The\ncommercial loan business often carries attractive spreads, especially in the middle market. We have\nseen only the very early signs of recovery in loan demand, including a pickup in bond issuance and\nsyndicated lending.\nBy one indicator, at least, small business confidence appears to be improving; a development that\nshould be important for community banks. The National Federation of Independent Businesses\nsurveys its members regularly about their sales outlook for the coming three-month period. Those\nsurveys show optimism rising since the summer of 2003. In fact, since November the number of firms\nexpecting an increase in sales exceeds those expecting a decline by more than 30 percentage points.\nThe survey hasn't shown that wide a margin with such a positive outlook for four years.\nAt this point, the available indicators suggest that banks' earnings prospects are favorable. The market\nseems to share that outlook, perhaps one reason why bank stock valuations have been improving.\nOngoing consolidation in the industry also plays a role, and we have seen a recent wave of merger\nannouncements among the largest bank holding companies. Based on what I hear from community\nbankers, mergers and acquisitions among big institutions have historically created opportunities for\ncommunity banks.\nI wouldn't be a bank regulator if I neglected to mention that bank capital ratios remain very strong.\nNearly 99 percent of banks in the United States are well-capitalized, which is a higher proportion than\nwe have ever seen. Some analysts have expressed concern that bankers would reduce their capital\nbuffers in order to increase dividend payments, especially as the tax treatment of dividend income\nbecame more favorable to stockholders. But in spite of these changes in the tax code, the aggregate\ndividend payout ratio at commercial banks increased only modestly, from 76.4 percent of income to\n77.4 percent of income.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the U.S. banking industry is healthy, strong, profitable and well-positioned to play its\nproper role in supporting growth and prosperity in our economy. Many of the factors that made 2003\nsuch a remarkable year for the industry look like they will carry over into 2004 as well. New challenges\nwill arise as we move ahead, of course, and perhaps some new opportunities as well. Adapting to\nchange is an important aspect of the banking business, and the industry's ability to respond well to\nchanging circumstances was a key to last year's record-setting results. I believe we can look forward\nwith confidence to continued strong performance from the banking industry.",

         "Ben S Bernanke: Money, gold and the Great Depression\nRemarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the H Parker Willis Lecture in Economic Policy, Washington and Lee University, Lexington,\nVirginia, 2 March 2004.\nThe references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.\n* * *\nI am pleased to be able to present the H. Parker Willis Lecture in Economic Policy here at Washington\nand Lee University. As you may know, Willis was an important figure in the early history of my current\nemployer, the Federal Reserve System. While he was a professor at Washington and Lee, Willis\nadvised Senator Carter Glass of Virginia, one of the key legislators involved in the founding of the\nFederal Reserve. Willis also served on the National Monetary Commission, which recommended the\ncreation of the Federal Reserve, and he went on to become the research director at the Federal\nReserve from 1918 to 1922. At the Federal Reserve, Willis pushed for the development of new and\nbetter economic statistics, facing the resistance of those who took the view that too many facts only\nconfuse the issue. Willis was also the first editor of the Federal Reserve Bulletin, the official publication\nof the Fed, which in Willis's time as well as today provides a wealth of economic statistics. As an\nillustration of the intellectual atmosphere in Washington at the time he served, Willis reported that\nBulletin\nwhen the first copy of the was presented to the Secretary of the Treasury, the esteemed\nSecretary replied, \"This Government ain't going into the newspaper business.\"\nLike Parker Willis, I was a professor myself before coming to the Federal Reserve Board. One topic of\nparticular interest to me as a researcher was the performance of the Federal Reserve in its early days,\nparticularly the part played by the young U.S. central bank in the Great Depression of the 1930s.1 In\nhonor of Willis's important contribution to the design and creation of the Federal Reserve, I will speak\ntoday about the role of the Federal Reserve and of monetary factors more generally in the origin and\npropagation of the Great Depression. Let me offer two caveats before I begin: First, as I mentioned, H.\nParker Willis resigned from the Fed in 1922, to take a post at Columbia University; thus, he is not\nimplicated in any of the mistakes that the Federal Reserve made in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\nSecond, the views I will express today are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nThe number of people with personal memory of the Great Depression is fast shrinking with the years,\nand to most of us the Depression is conveyed by grainy, black-and-white images of men in hats and\nlong coats standing in bread lines. However, although the Depression was long ago - October this\nyear will mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the famous 1929 stock market crash - its influence is still\nvery much with us. In particular, the experience of the Depression helped forge a consensus that the\ngovernment bears the important responsibility of trying to stabilize the economy and the financial\nsystem, as well as of assisting people affected by economic downturns. Dozens of our most important\ngovernment agencies and programs, ranging from social security (to assist the elderly and disabled) to\nfederal deposit insurance (to eliminate banking panics) to the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(to regulate financial activities) were created in the 1930s, each a legacy of the Depression.\nThe impact that the experience of the Depression has had on views about the role of the government\nin the economy is easily understood when we recall the sheer magnitude of that economic downturn.\nDuring the major contraction phase of the Depression, between 1929 and 1933, real output in the\nUnited States fell nearly 30 percent. During the same period, according to retrospective studies, the\nunemployment rate rose from about 3 percent to nearly 25 percent, and many of those lucky enough\nto have a job were able to work only part-time. For comparison, between 1973 and 1975, in what was\nperhaps the most severe U.S. recession of the World War II era, real output fell 3.4 percent and the\nunemployment rate rose from about 4 percent to about 9 percent. Other features of the 1929-33\ndecline included a sharp deflation - prices fell at a rate of nearly 10 percent per year during the early\n1930s - as well as a plummeting stock market, widespread bank failures, and a rash of defaults and\nbankruptcies by businesses and households. The economy improved after Franklin D. Roosevelt's\ninauguration in March 1933, but unemployment remained in the double digits for the rest of the\ndecade, full recovery arriving only with the advent of World War II. Moreover, as I will discuss later, the\nDepression was international in scope, affecting most countries around the world not only the United\nStates.\nWhat caused the Depression? This question is a difficult one, but answering it is important if we are to\ndraw the right lessons from the experience for economic policy. Solving the puzzle of the Depression\nis also crucial to the field of economics itself because of the light the solution would shed on our basic\nunderstanding of how the economy works.\nDuring the Depression years and for many decades afterward, economists disagreed sharply on the\nsources of the economic and financial collapse of the 1930s. In contrast, during the past twenty years\nor so economic historians have come to a broad consensus about the causes of the Depression. A\nwidening of the geographic focus of Depression research deserves much of the credit for this\nbreakthrough. Before the 1980s, research on the causes of the Depression had considered primarily\nthe experience of the United States. This attention to the U.S. case was appropriate to some degree,\nas the U.S. economy was then, as it is today, the world's largest; the decline in output and\nemployment in the United States during the 1930s was especially severe; and many economists have\nargued that, to an important extent, the worldwide Depression began in the United States, spreading\nfrom here to other countries (Romer, 1993). However, in much the same way that a medical\nresearcher cannot reliably infer the causes of an illness by studying one patient, diagnosing the\ncauses of the Depression is easier when we have more patients (in this case, more national\neconomies) to study. To explain the current consensus on the causes of the Depression, I will first\ndescribe the debate as it existed before 1980, and then discuss how the recent focus on international\naspects of the Depression and the comparative analysis of the experiences of different countries have\nhelped to resolve that debate.\nI have already mentioned the sharp deflation of the price level that occurred during the contraction\nphase of the Depression, by far the most severe episode of deflation experienced in the United States\nbefore or since. Deflation, like inflation, tends to be closely linked to changes in the national money\nsupply, defined as the sum of currency and bank deposits outstanding, and such was the case in the\nDepression. Like real output and prices, the U.S. money supply fell about one-third between 1929 and\n1933, rising in subsequent years as output and prices rose.\nWhile the fact that money, prices, and output all declined rapidly in the early years of the Depression is\nundeniable, the interpretation of that fact has been the subject of much controversy. Indeed,\nhistorically, much of the debate on the causes of the Great Depression has centered on the role of\nmonetary factors, including both monetary policy and other influences on the national money supply,\nsuch as the condition of the banking system. Views have changed over time. During the Depression\nitself, and in several decades following, most economists argued that monetary factors were not an\nimportant cause of the Depression. For example, many observers pointed to the fact that nominal\ninterest rates were close to zero during much of the Depression, concluding that monetary policy had\nbeen about as easy as possible yet had produced no tangible benefits to the economy. The attempt to\nuse monetary policy to extricate an economy from a deep depression was often compared to \"pushing\non a string.\"\nDuring the first decades after the Depression, most economists looked to developments on the real\nside of the economy for explanations, rather than to monetary factors. Some argued, for example, that\noverinvestment and overbuilding had taken place during the ebullient 1920s, leading to a crash when\nthe returns on those investments proved to be less than expected. Another once-popular theory was\nthat a chronic problem of \"under-consumption\" - the inability of households to purchase enough goods\nand services to utilize the economy's productive capacity - had precipitated the slump.\nHowever, in 1963, Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz transformed the debate about the Great\nA Monetary History of the United\nDepression. That year saw the publication of their now-classic book,\nStates, 1867-1960. The Monetary History, the name by which the book is instantly recognized by any\nmacroeconomist, examined in great detail the relationship between changes in the national money\nstock - whether determined by conscious policy or by more impersonal forces such as changes in the\nbanking system - and changes in national income and prices. The broader objective of the book was\nto understand how monetary forces had influenced the U.S. economy over a nearly a century. In the\nprocess of pursuing this general objective, however, Friedman and Schwartz offered important new\nevidence and arguments about the role of monetary factors in the Great Depression. In contradiction\nto the prevalent view of the time, that money and monetary policy played at most a purely passive role\nin the Depression, Friedman and Schwartz argued that \"the [economic] contraction is in fact a tragic\ntestimonial to the importance of monetary forces\" (Friedman and Schwartz, 1963, p. 300).\nTo support their view that monetary forces caused the Great Depression, Friedman and Schwartz\nrevisited the historical record and identified a series of errors - errors of both commission and\nomission - made by the Federal Reserve in the late 1920s and early 1930s. According to Friedman\nand Schwartz, each of these policy mistakes led to an undesirable tightening of monetary policy, as\nreflected in sharp declines in the money supply. Drawing on their historical evidence about the effects\nof money on the economy, Friedman and Schwartz argued that the declines in the money stock\ngenerated by Fed actions - or inactions - could account for the drops in prices and output that\nsubsequently occurred.2\nFriedman and Schwartz emphasized at least four major errors by U.S. monetary policymakers. The\nFed's first grave mistake, in their view, was the tightening of monetary policy that began in the spring\nof 1928 and continued until the stock market crash of October 1929 (see Hamilton, 1987, or Bernanke,\n2002a, for further discussion). This tightening of monetary policy in 1928 did not seem particularly\njustified by the macroeconomic environment: The economy was only just emerging from a recession,\ncommodity prices were declining sharply, and there was little hint of inflation. Why then did the Federal\nReserve raise interest rates in 1928? The principal reason was the Fed's ongoing concern about\nspeculation on Wall Street. Fed policymakers drew a sharp distinction between \"productive\" (that is,\ngood) and \"speculative\" (bad) uses of credit, and they were concerned that bank lending to brokers\nand investors was fueling a speculative wave in the stock market. When the Fed's attempts to\npersuade banks not to lend for speculative purposes proved ineffective, Fed officials decided to\ndissuade lending directly by raising the policy interest rate.\nThe market crash of October 1929 showed, if anyone doubted it, that a concerted effort by the Fed\ncan bring down stock prices. But the cost of this \"victory\" was very high. According to Friedman and\nSchwartz, the Fed's tight-money policies led to the onset of a recession in August 1929, according to\nthe official dating by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The slowdown in economic activity,\ntogether with high interest rates, was in all likelihood the most important source of the stock market\ncrash that followed in October. In other words, the market crash, rather than being the cause of the\nDepression, as popular legend has it, was in fact largely the result of an economic slowdown and the\ninappropriate monetary policies that preceded it. Of course, the stock market crash only worsened the\neconomic situation, hurting consumer and business confidence and contributing to a still deeper\ndownturn in 1930.\nThe second monetary policy action identified by Friedman and Schwartz occurred in September and\nOctober of 1931. At the time, as I will discuss in more detail later, the United States and the great\nmajority of other nations were on the gold standard, a system in which the value of each currency is\nexpressed in terms of ounces of gold. Under the gold standard, central banks stood ready to maintain\nthe fixed values of their currencies by offering to trade gold for money at the legally determined rate of\nexchange.\nThe fact that, under the gold standard, the value of each currency was fixed in terms of gold implied\nthat the rate of exchange between any two currencies within the gold standard system was likewise\nfixed. As with any system of fixed exchange rates, the gold standard was subject to speculative attack\nif investors doubted the ability of a country to maintain the value of its currency at the legally specified\nparity. In September 1931, following a period of financial upheaval in Europe that created concerns\nabout British investments on the Continent, speculators attacked the British pound, presenting pounds\nto the Bank of England and demanding gold in return. Faced with the heavy demands of speculators\nfor gold and a widespread loss of confidence in the pound, the Bank of England quickly depleted its\ngold reserves. Unable to continue supporting the pound at its official value, Great Britain was forced to\nleave the gold standard, allowing the pound to float freely, its value determined by market forces.\nWith the collapse of the pound, speculators turned their attention to the U.S. dollar, which (given the\neconomic difficulties the United States was experiencing in the fall of 1931) looked to many to be the\nnext currency in line for devaluation. Central banks as well as private investors converted a substantial\nquantity of dollar assets to gold in September and October of 1931, reducing the Federal Reserve's\ngold reserves. The speculative attack on the dollar also helped to create a panic in the U.S. banking\nsystem. Fearing imminent devaluation of the dollar, many foreign and domestic depositors withdrew\ntheir funds from U.S. banks in order to convert them into gold or other assets. The worsening\neconomic situation also made depositors increasingly distrustful of banks as a place to keep their\nsavings. During this period, deposit insurance was virtually nonexistent, so that the failure of a bank\nmight cause depositors to lose all or most of their savings. Thus, depositors who feared that a bank\nmight fail rushed to withdraw their funds. Banking panics, if severe enough, could become\nself-confirming prophecies. During the 1930s, thousands of U.S. banks experienced runs by\ndepositors and subsequently failed.\nLong-established central banking practice required that the Fed respond both to the speculative attack\non the dollar and to the domestic banking panics. However, the Fed decided to ignore the plight of the\nbanking system and to focus only on stopping the loss of gold reserves to protect the dollar. To\nstabilize the dollar, the Fed once again raised interest rates sharply, on the view that currency\nspeculators would be less willing to liquidate dollar assets if they could earn a higher rate of return on\nthem. The Fed's strategy worked, in that the attack on the dollar subsided and the U.S. commitment to\nthe gold standard was successfully defended, at least for the moment. However, once again the Fed\nhad chosen to tighten monetary policy despite the fact that macroeconomic conditions - including an\naccelerating decline in output, prices, and the money supply - seemed to demand policy ease.\nThe third policy action highlighted by Friedman and Schwartz occurred in 1932. By the spring of that\nyear, the Depression was well advanced, and Congress began to place considerable pressure on the\nFederal Reserve to ease monetary policy. The Board was quite reluctant to comply, but in response to\nthe ongoing pressure the Board conducted open-market operations between April and June of 1932\ndesigned to increase the national money supply and thus ease policy. These policy actions reduced\ninterest rates on government bonds and corporate debt and appeared to arrest the decline in prices\nand economic activity. However, Fed officials remained ambivalent about their policy of monetary\nexpansion. Some viewed the Depression as the necessary purging of financial excesses built up\nduring the 1920s; in this view, slowing the economic collapse by easing monetary policy only delayed\nthe inevitable adjustment. Other officials, noting among other indicators the very low level of nominal\ninterest rates, concluded that monetary policy was in fact already quite easy and that no more should\nbe done. These policymakers did not appear to appreciate that, even though nominal interest rates\nwere very low, the ongoing deflation meant that the real cost of borrowing was very high because any\nloans would have to be repaid in dollars of much greater value (Meltzer, 2003). Thus monetary policy\nwas not in fact easy at all, despite the very low level of nominal interest rates. In any event, Fed\nofficials convinced themselves that the policy ease advocated by the Congress was not appropriate,\nand so when the Congress adjourned in July 1932, the Fed reversed the policy. By the latter part of\nthe year, the economy had relapsed dramatically.\nThe fourth and final policy mistake emphasized by Friedman and Schwartz was the Fed's ongoing\nneglect of problems in the U.S. banking sector. As I have already described, the banking sector faced\nenormous pressure during the early 1930s. As depositor fears about the health of banks grew, runs on\nbanks became increasingly common. A series of banking panics spread across the country, often\naffecting all the banks in a major city or even an entire region of the country. Between December 1930\nand March 1933, when President Roosevelt declared a \"banking holiday\" that shut down the entire\nU.S. banking system, about half of U.S. banks either closed or merged with other banks. Surviving\nbanks, rather than expanding their deposits and loans to replace those of the banks lost to panics,\nretrenched sharply.\nThe banking crisis had highly detrimental effects on the broader economy. Friedman and Schwartz\nemphasized the effects of bank failures on the money supply. Because bank deposits are a form of\nmoney, the closing of many banks greatly exacerbated the decline in the money supply. Moreover,\nafraid to leave their funds in banks, people hoarded cash, for example by burying their savings in\ncoffee cans in the back yard. Hoarding effectively removed money from circulation, adding further to\nthe deflationary pressures. Moreover, as I emphasized in early research of my own (Bernanke, 1983),\nthe virtual shutting down of the U.S. banking system also deprived the economy of an important\nsource of credit and other services normally provided by banks.\nThe Federal Reserve had the power at least to ameliorate the problems of the banks. For example,\nthe Fed could have been more aggressive in lending cash to banks (taking their loans and other\ninvestments as collateral), or it could have simply put more cash in circulation. Either action would\nhave made it easier for banks to obtain the cash necessary to pay off depositors, which might have\nstopped bank runs before they resulted in bank closings and failures. Indeed, a central element of the\nFederal Reserve's original mission had been to provide just this type of assistance to the banking\nsystem. The Fed's failure to fulfill its mission was, again, largely the result of the economic theories\nheld by the Federal Reserve leadership. Many Fed officials appeared to subscribe to the infamous\n\"liquidationist\" thesis of Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, who argued that weeding out \"weak\"\nbanks was a harsh but necessary prerequisite to the recovery of the banking system. Moreover, most\nof the failing banks were relatively small and not members of the Federal Reserve System, making\ntheir fate of less interest to the policymakers. In the end, Fed officials decided not to intervene in the\nbanking crisis, contributing once again to the precipitous fall in the money supply.\nFriedman and Schwartz discuss other episodes and policy actions as well, such as the Federal\nReserve's misguided tightening of policy in 1937-38 which contributed to a new recession in those\nyears. However, the four episodes I have described capture the gist of the Friedman and Schwartz\nargument that, for a variety of reasons, monetary policy was unnecessarily tight, both before the\nDepression began and during its most dramatic downward phase. As I have mentioned, Friedman and\nSchwartz had produced evidence from other historical periods that suggested that contractionary\nmonetary policies can lead to declining prices and output. Friedman and Schwartz concluded therefore\nthat they had found the smoking gun, evidence that much of the severity of the Great Depression\ncould be attributed to monetary forces.\nFriedman and Schwartz's arguments were highly influential but not universally accepted. For several\nMonetary History\ndecades after the was published, a debate raged about the importance of monetary\nfactors in the Depression. Opponents made several objections to the Friedman and Schwartz thesis\nthat are worth highlighting here.\nFirst, critics wondered whether the tightening of monetary policy during 1928 and 1929, though\nperhaps ill advised, was large enough to have led to such calamitous consequences.3 If the tightening\nof monetary policy before the stock market crash was not sufficient to account for the violence of the\neconomic downturn, then other, possibly nonmonetary, factors may need to be considered as well.\nA second question is whether the large decline in the money supply seen during the 1930s was\nprimarily a cause or an effect of falling output and prices. As we have seen, Friedman and Schwartz\nargued that the decline in the money supply was causal. Suppose, though, for the sake of argument,\nthat the Depression was the result primarily of nonmonetary factors, such as overspending and\noverinvestment during the 1920s. As incomes and spending decline, people need less money to carry\nout daily transactions. In this scenario, critics pointed out, the Fed would be justified in allowing the\nmoney supply to fall, because it would only be accommodating a decline in the amount of money that\npeople want to hold. The decline in the money supply in this case would be a response to, not a cause\nof, the decline in output and prices. To put the question simply, we know that both the economy and\nthe money stock contracted rapidly during the early 1930s, but was the monetary dog wagging the\neconomic tail, or vice versa?\nThe focus of Friedman and Schwartz on the U.S. experience (by design, of course) raised other\nquestions about their monetary explanation of the Depression. As I have mentioned, the Great\nDepression was a worldwide phenomenon, not confined to the United States. Indeed, some\neconomies, such as that of Germany, began to decline before 1929. Although few countries escaped\nthe Depression entirely, the severity of the episode varied widely across countries. The timing of\nrecovery also varied considerably, with some countries beginning their recovery as early as 1931 or\n1932, whereas others remained in the depths of depression as late as 1935 or 1936. How does\nFriedman and Schwartz's monetary thesis explain the worldwide nature of the onset of the\nDepression, and the differences in severity and timing observed in different countries?\nThat is where the debate stood around 1980. About that time, however, economic historians began to\nbroaden their focus, shifting from a heavy emphasis on events in the United States during the 1930s\nto an increased attention to developments around the world. Moreover, rather than studying countries\nindividually, this new scholarship took a comparative approach, asking specifically why some countries\nfared better than others in the 1930s. As I will explain, this research uncovered an important role for\ninternational monetary forces, as well as domestic monetary policies, in explaining the Depression.\nSpecifically, the new research found that a complete understanding of the Depression requires\nattention to the operation of the international gold standard, the international monetary system of the\ntime.4\nAs I have already mentioned, the gold standard is a monetary system in which each participating\ncountry defines its monetary unit in terms of a certain amount of gold. The setting of each currency's\nvalue in terms of gold defines a system of fixed exchange rates, in which the relative value of (say) the\nU.S. dollar and the British pound are fixed at a rate determined by the relative gold content of each\ncurrency. To maintain the gold standard, central banks had to promise to exchange actual gold for\ntheir paper currencies at the legal rate.\nThe gold standard appeared to be highly successful from about 1870 to the beginning of World War I\nin 1914. During the so-called \"classical\" gold standard period, international trade and capital flows\nexpanded markedly, and central banks experienced relatively few problems ensuring that their\ncurrencies retained their legal value. The gold standard was suspended during World War I, however,\nbecause of disruptions to trade and international capital flows and because countries needed more\nfinancial flexibility to finance their war efforts. (The United States remained technically on the gold\nstandard throughout the war, but with many restrictions.)\nAfter 1918, when the war ended, nations around the world made extensive efforts to reconstitute the\ngold standard, believing that it would be a key element in the return to normal functioning of the\ninternational economic system. Great Britain was among the first of the major countries to return to the\ngold standard, in 1925, and by 1929 the great majority of the world's nations had done so.\nUnlike the gold standard before World War I, however, the gold standard as reconstituted in the 1920s\nproved to be both unstable and destabilizing. Economic historians have identified a number of reasons\nwhy the reconstituted gold standard was so much less successful than its prewar counterpart. First,\nthe war had left behind enormous economic destruction and dislocation. Major financial problems also\nremained, including both large government debts from the war and banking systems whose solvency\nhad been deeply compromised by the war and by the periods of hyperinflation that followed in a\nnumber of countries. These underlying problems created stresses for the gold standard that had not\nexisted to the same degree before the war.\nSecond, the new system lacked effective international leadership. During the classical period, the\nBank of England, in operation since 1694, provided sophisticated management of the international\nsystem, with the cooperation of other major central banks. This leadership helped the system adjust to\nimbalances and strains; for example, a consortium of central banks might lend gold to one of their\nnumber that was experiencing a shortage of reserves. After the war, with Great Britain economically\nand financially depleted and the United States in ascendance, leadership of the international system\nshifted by default to the Federal Reserve. Unfortunately, the fledgling Federal Reserve, with its\ndecentralized structure and its inexperienced and domestically focused leadership, did not prove up to\nthe task of managing the international gold standard, a task that lingering hatreds and disputes from\nthe war would have made difficult for even the most-sophisticated institution. With the lack of effective\ninternational leadership, most central banks of the 1920s and 1930s devoted little effort to supporting\nthe overall stability of the international system and focused instead on conditions within their own\ncountries.\nFinally, the reconstituted gold standard lacked the credibility of its prewar counterpart. Before the war,\nthe ideology of the gold standard was dominant, to the point that financial investors had no doubt that\ncentral banks would find a way to maintain the gold values of their currencies no matter what the\ncircumstances. Because this conviction was so firm, speculators had little incentive to attack a major\ncurrency. After the war, in contrast, both economic views and the political balance of power had shifted\nin ways that reduced the influence of the gold standard ideology. For example, new labor-dominated\npolitical parties were skeptical about the utility of maintaining the gold standard if doing so increased\nunemployment. Ironically, reduced political and ideological support for the gold standard made it more\ndifficult for central banks to maintain the gold values of their currencies, as speculators understood\nthat the underlying commitment to adhere to the gold standard at all costs had been weakened\nsignificantly. Thus, speculative attacks became much more likely to succeed and hence more likely to\noccur.\nWith an international focus, and with particular attention to the role of the gold standard in the world\neconomy, scholars have now been able to answer the questions regarding the monetary interpretation\nof the Depression that I raised earlier.\nFirst, the existence of the gold standard helps to explain why the world economic decline was both\ndeep and broadly international. Under the gold standard, the need to maintain a fixed exchange rate\namong currencies forces countries to adopt similar monetary policies. In particular, a central bank with\nlimited gold reserves has no option but to raise its own interest rates when interest rates are being\nraised abroad; if it did not do so, it would quickly lose gold reserves as financial investors transferred\ntheir funds to countries where returns were higher. Hence, when the Federal Reserve raised interest\nrates in 1928 to fight stock market speculation, it inadvertently forced tightening of monetary policy in\nmany other countries as well. This tightening abroad weakened the global economy, with effects that\nfed back to the U.S. economy and financial system.\nOther countries' policies also contributed to a global monetary tightening during 1928 and 1929. For\nexample, after France returned to the gold standard in 1928, it built up its gold reserves significantly, at\nthe expense of other countries. The outflows of gold to France forced other countries to reduce their\nmoney supplies and to raise interest rates. Speculative attacks on currencies also became frequent as\nthe Depression worsened, leading central banks to raise interest rates, much like the Federal Reserve\ndid in 1931. Leadership from the Federal Reserve might possibly have produced better international\ncooperation and a more appropriate set of monetary policies. However, in the absence of that\nleadership, the worldwide monetary contraction proceeded apace. The result was a global economic\ndecline that reinforced the effects of tight monetary policies in individual countries.\nThe transmission of monetary tightening through the gold standard also addresses the question of\nwhether changes in the money supply helped cause the Depression or were simply a passive\nresponse to the declines in income and prices. Countries on the gold standard were often forced to\ncontract their money supplies because of policy developments in other countries, not because of\ndomestic events. The fact that these contractions in money supplies were invariably followed by\ndeclines in output and prices suggests that money was more a cause than an effect of the economic\ncollapse in those countries.\nPerhaps the most fascinating discovery arising from researchers' broader international focus is that\nthe extent to which a country adhered to the gold standard and the severity of its depression were\nclosely linked. In particular, the longer that a country remained committed to gold, the deeper its\ndepression and the later its recovery (Choudhri and Kochin, 1980; Eichengreen and Sachs, 1985).\nThe willingness or ability of countries to remain on the gold standard despite the adverse\ndevelopments of the 1930s varied quite a bit. A few countries did not join the gold standard system at\nall; these included Spain (which was embroiled in domestic political upheaval, eventually leading to\ncivil war) and China (which used a silver monetary standard rather than a gold standard). A number of\ncountries adopted the gold standard in the 1920s but left or were forced off gold relatively early,\ntypically in 1931. Countries in this category included Great Britain, Japan, and several Scandinavian\ncountries. Some countries, such as Italy and the United States, remained on the gold standard into\n1932 or 1933. And a few diehards, notably the so-called gold bloc, led by France and including\nPoland, Belgium, and Switzerland, remained on gold into 1935 or 1936.\nIf declines in the money supply induced by adherence to the gold standard were a principal reason for\neconomic depression, then countries leaving gold earlier should have been able to avoid the worst of\nthe Depression and begin an earlier process of recovery. The evidence strongly supports this\nimplication. For example, Great Britain and Scandinavia, which left the gold standard in 1931,\nrecovered much earlier than France and Belgium, which stubbornly remained on gold. As Friedman\nand Schwartz noted in their book, countries such as China - which used a silver standard rather than a\ngold standard - avoided the Depression almost entirely. The finding that the time at which a country\nleft the gold standard is the key determinant of the severity of its depression and the timing of its\nrecovery has been shown to hold for literally dozens of countries, including developing countries. This\nintriguing result not only provides additional evidence for the importance of monetary factors in the\nDepression, it also explains why the timing of recovery from the Depression differed across countries.\nThe finding that leaving the gold standard was the key to recovery from the Great Depression was\ncertainly confirmed by the U.S. experience. One of the first actions of President Roosevelt was to\neliminate the constraint on U.S. monetary policy created by the gold standard, first by allowing the\ndollar to float and then by resetting its value at a significantly lower level. The new President also\naddressed another major source of monetary contraction, the ongoing banking crisis. Within days of\nhis inauguration, Roosevelt declared a \"bank holiday,\" shutting down all the banks in the country.\nBanks were allowed to reopen only when certified to be in sound financial condition. Roosevelt\npursued other measures to stabilize the banking system as well, such as the creation of a deposit\ninsurance program. With the gold standard constraint removed and the banking system stabilized, the\nmoney supply and the price level began to rise. Between Roosevelt's coming to power in 1933 and the\nrecession of 1937-38, the economy grew strongly.\nI have only scratched the surface of the fascinating literature on the causes of the Great Depression,\nbut it is time that I conclude. Economists have made a great deal of progress in understanding the\nGreat Depression. Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz deserve enormous credit for bringing the role\nof monetary factors to the fore in their Monetary History. However, expanding the research focus to\ninclude the experiences of a wide range of countries has both provided additional support for the role\nof monetary factors (including the international gold standard) and enriched our understanding of the\ncauses of the Depression.\nSome important lessons emerge from the story. One lesson is that ideas are critical. The gold\nstandard orthodoxy, the adherence of some Federal Reserve policymakers to the liquidationist thesis,\nand the incorrect view that low nominal interest rates necessarily signaled monetary ease, all led\npolicymakers astray, with disastrous consequences. We should not underestimate the need for careful\nresearch and analysis in guiding policy. Another lesson is that central banks and other governmental\nagencies have an important responsibility to maintain financial stability. The banking crises of the\n1930s, both in the United States and abroad, were a significant source of output declines, both\nthrough their effects on money supplies and on credit supplies. Finally, perhaps the most important\nlesson of all is that price stability should be a key objective of monetary policy. By allowing persistent\ndeclines in the money supply and in the price level, the Federal Reserve of the late 1920s and 1930s\ngreatly destabilized the U.S. economy and, through the workings of the gold standard, the economies\nof many other nations as well.",

         "Alan Greenspan: Current account\nRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, before the Economic Club of New York, New York, 2 March 2004.\n* * *\nIt has been a number of years since the foreign exchange rate of the dollar has played so prominent a\nrole in evaluations of economic activity.\nI have no intention today of discussing the foreign exchange policy of the United States. That is the\nprovince of the Secretary of the Treasury. Nor do I intend to project exchange rates. My experience is\nthat exchange markets have become so efficient that virtually all relevant information is embedded\nalmost instantaneously in exchange rates to the point that anticipating movements in major currencies\nis rarely possible. The exceptions to this conclusion are those few cases of successful speculation in\nwhich governments have tried and failed to support a particular exchange rate.\nNonetheless, despite extensive efforts on the part of analysts, to my knowledge, no model projecting\ndirectional movements in exchange rates is significantly superior to tossing a coin. I am aware that of\nthe thousands who try, some are quite successful. So are winners of coin-tossing contests. The\nseeming ability of a number of banking organizations to make consistent profits from foreign exchange\ntrading likely derives not from their insight into future rate changes but from market making.\nThis may seem a rather surprising conclusion, given that so many commentators apparently believe\nthat they know the real value of the dollar must decline further because of the record current account\ndeficit of the United States. It should be sobering to recall that three years ago - February 2001 - to be\nexact for similar reasons a vast majority of a large panel of forecasters were projecting a lower dollar\nagainst the euro. In the subsequent twelve months, the dollar rose nearly 6 percent against the euro.\nRather than engage in exchange rate forecasting, today I will discuss certain developments in foreign\nexchange markets, and in the international financial system in general, which bear on the ultimate\noutcome of our current account adjustment process. Before raising the broader issues of adjustment, I\nshould like to address the actions of certain of the players in the exchange market that are likely to\ndelay the adjustment process, but only for a time.\nI refer to the heavy degree of intervention by East Asian monetary authorities, especially in Japan and\nChina, and the apparent stepped up hedging of currency movements by exporters, especially in\nEurope. As all of you who follow these markets are aware, since the start of 2002, the extraordinary\npurchases by Asian central banks and governments of dollar assets, largely those by Japan and\nChina, have totaled almost $240 billion, all in an apparent attempt to prevent their currencies from\nrising against the dollar. In particular, total foreign exchange reserves for China reached $420 billion in\nNovember of last year and for Japan more than $650 billion in December.\nThe awesome size of Japan's accumulation results from persistent intervention to suppress what\nJapanese authorities have judged is a dollar-yen exchange rate that is out of line with fundamentals.\nOne factor boosting the yen is a significant yen bias on the part of Japanese investors. This\npropensity, in my judgment, runs far beyond the normal tendency of investors worldwide to buy\nfamiliar domestic assets and eschew foreign-exchange risk.\nNowhere else in the world will investors voluntarily purchase ten-year government obligations at an\ninterest rate of 1 percent or less, especially given a rate of increase in the outstanding supply of\ngovernment debt that has generally been running at 9 percent over the past year. Not surprisingly,\nvery few Japanese government bonds (JGBs) are held outside of Japan.\nAside from the holdings of the Bank of Japan, almost all JGBs are held by Japanese households,\nbanks, insurance companies and the postal saving system. And none of them holds significant\namounts of foreign assets; 99 percent of household assets are in yen, and, including the postal saving\nsystem, about 91 percent of the assets of financial institutions are in yen. Japanese nonfinancial\ncorporations do hold a larger share of foreign assets in their securities' portfolios, but the absolute\namounts are small. The Japanese have made significant foreign direct investments, especially in the\nUnited States, and the Ministry of Finance does, of course, hold large dollar balances as a\nconsequence of exchange rate intervention. But the Japanese private sector, by and large, has\nexhibited limited interest in accumulating dollar or other foreign assets, removing what in other large\ntrading economies would be a significant segment of demand for foreign assets.\nThe degree of domestic currency bias in Japan, which far exceeds that of its trading partners, may\nthus have contributed to a foreign exchange rate for the yen that appears to be elevated relative to the\ndollar and possibly other internationally traded currencies as well.1 Of course, this preference for yen\nassets, while a persistent influence on the value of the yen, has at times been overwhelmed by other\nfactors.\nGranted the level of intervention pursued by the Japanese monetary authorities has influenced the\nmarket value of the yen, but the size of the impact is difficult to judge. In any event, it must be\npresumed that the rate of accumulation of dollar assets by the Japanese government will have to slow\nat some point and eventually cease. For now, partially unsterilized intervention is perceived as a\nmeans of expanding the monetary base of Japan, a basic element of monetary policy. (The same\neffect, of course, is available through the purchase of domestic assets.) In time, however, as the\npresent deflationary situation abates, the monetary consequences of continued intervention could\nbecome problematic. The current performance of the Japanese economy suggests that we are getting\ncloser to the point where continued intervention at the present scale will no longer meet the monetary\npolicy needs of Japan.\nChina is a similar story. In order to maintain the tight relationship with the dollar initiated in the 1990s,\nthe Chinese central bank has chosen to purchase large quantities of U.S. Treasury securities with\nrenminbi. What is not clear is how much of the current upward pressure on the currency results from\nunderlying market forces, how much from capital inflows owing to speculation on potential revaluation,\nand how much from capital controls that suppress the demand of Chinese residents for dollars and\nother currencies.\nNo one truly knows whether easing or ending capital controls would lessen pressure on the currency\nand, in the process, also eliminate inflows from speculation on a revaluation. Many in China, however,\nfear that an immediate ending of controls could induce capital outflows large enough to destabilize the\nnation's improving, but still fragile, banking system. Others believe that decontrol, but at a gradual\npace, could conceivably avoid such an outcome.\nChinese central bank purchases of dollars, unless offset, threaten an excess of so-called\nhigh-powered money expansion and a consequent overheating of the Chinese economy. The Chinese\ncentral bank last year offset - that is, sterilized - much of its heavy dollar purchases by reducing its\nloans to commercial banks, by selling bonds, and by increasing reserve requirements.\nBut the ratio of the money supply to the monetary base in China has been rising steadily for a number\nof years as financial efficiency improves. Thus the modest rise that has occurred in currency and\ncommercial bank reserves has been enough to support a twelve-month growth of the M2 money\nsupply in the neighborhood of 20 percent through 2003 and a bit less so far this year. Should this\npattern continue, the central bank will be confronted with the choice of curtailing its purchases of dollar\nassets or facing an overheated economy with the associated economic instabilities. Lesser dollar\npurchases presumably would allow the renminbi, at least temporarily, to appreciate against the dollar.\nOther East Asian monetary authorities, in an endeavor to hold their currencies at a par with the yen\nand the renminbi, accumulated about $120 billion in reserves in 2003 and appear to have continued\nthat rate of intervention since.\n* * *\nThere is a general view that this heavy intervention places upward pressure on the euro. It is assumed\nthat the dollar's trade-weighted exchange rate reflects its worldwide fundamentals, and therefore if the\nAsian currencies are being suppressed, the euro and other non-Asian currencies need to appreciate\nas an offset.\nBut a more likely possibility is that Asian currency intervention has had little effect on other currencies\nand that the trade-weighted average of the dollar is, thus, somewhat elevated relative to the rate that\nwould have prevailed absent intervention. When Asian authorities intervene to ease their currencies\nagainst the dollar, they purchase dollar-denominated assets from private sector portfolios. With fewer\ndollar assets in private hands, the natural inclination to rebalance portfolios will tend to buoy the dollar\neven against currencies that are not used in intervention operations, including the euro. These\ntransactions raise the dollar against, for example, the yen, lower the yen against the euro, and lower\nthe euro against the dollar. The strength of the euro against the dollar thus appears to be the\nconsequence of forces unrelated to Asian intervention. As I will explain later, this does not mean that\nwhen Asian intervention ceases the dollar will automatically fall because other influences on the dollar\ncannot be foreseen.\nSome have argued that purchases of U.S. Treasuries by Asian officials are holding down interest rates\non these instruments, and therefore U.S. interest rates are likely to rise as intervention by Asian\nmonetary authorities slows, ceases, or even turns to net sales. While there are obvious reasons to be\nconcerned about such an outcome, the effect of a reduction in the scale of intervention, or even net\nsales, on U.S. financial markets would likely be small. The reason is that central bank reserves are\nheavily concentrated in short-term maturities; moreover, the overall market in short-term dollar assets,\ncombining both public and private instruments, is huge relative to the size of asset holdings of Asian\nmonetary authorities. And because these issues are short-term and hence capable of only limited\nprice change, realized capital losses, if any, would be small. Accordingly, any incentive for monetary\nauthorities to sell dollars, in order to preserve market value, would be muted.\n* * *\nA different issue arises with the apparent level of hedging by exporters in Europe and elsewhere. The\neffect, however, is the same as Asian official intervention: It slows the process of adjustment.\nAgainst a broad basket of currencies of our trading partners, the foreign exchange value of the U.S.\ndollar has declined about 12 percent from its peak in early 2002. Ordinarily, currency depreciation is\naccompanied by a rise in the dollar prices of our imported goods and services, because foreign\nexporters seek to avoid price declines in their own currencies, which would otherwise result from the\nfall in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.\nReflecting the swing from dollar appreciation to dollar depreciation, the dollar prices of goods and\nservices imported into the United States have begun to rise after declining on balance for several\nyears. But the turnaround to date has been moderate and far short of that implied by the exchange\nrate change. Apparently, foreign exporters have been willing to absorb some of the price decline\nmeasured in their own currencies and the consequent squeeze on profit margins it entails in order to\nhold market share. In fact, given that the nearly 9 percent rise in dollar prices of goods imported from\nwestern Europe since the start of 2002 has been far short of the rise in the euro, profit margins of\neuro-area exporters to the United States may well have turned negative.\nNonetheless, euro-area exports to the United States, when expressed in euros, have slowed only\nmodestly. A possible reason is that European exporters' incentives to sell to the United States were\ndiminished significantly less than indicated by the dollar price and exchange rate movements owing to\naccelerated short forward positions against the dollar in foreign exchange markets. A marked increase\nin foreign exchange derivative trading, especially in dollar-euro, according to the Bank for International\nSettlements, is consistent with increased hedging of exports to the United States and to other markets\nthat use currencies tied to the U.S. dollar.2\nHowever, most contracts are short-term because long-term hedging is expensive. Thus, although\nhedging may delay, and perhaps even smooth out, the adjustment, it cannot eliminate, without\nprohibitive cost, the consequences of exchange rate change. Accordingly, the currency depreciation\nthat we have experienced of late should eventually help to contain our current account deficit as\nforeign producers export less to the United States. On the other side of the ledger, the current account\nshould improve as U.S. firms find the export market more receptive. But in the process, dollar prices of\nimports will surely rise.\n* * *\nWhen the temporary forestalling of the U.S. balance of payments adjustment process comes to an\nend, does that suggest a steepening of the decline in the dollar's exchange rate?\nAs I pointed out in the beginning, the most sophisticated analytical techniques have been unable to\nprofitably project the exchange rates of major currencies. Yet, most commentators argue that because\nthe current account deficit must eventually narrow, the price-adjusted value of the dollar must\naccordingly decline. But how can exchange rates and the current account be systematically related, if\nexchange rates are inherently unpredictable? The answer is that the point at which the U.S. current\naccount deficit will be forced to narrow is itself inherently difficult to predict. The current account\nreflects the myriad forces that bring our transactions with foreign economies into balance at our\nborders, of which exchange rates are only one. But those forces that, in the end, are reflected in a\ncurrent account surplus or deficit are both domestic and foreign. Indeed, our current account balance\ncan be shown to be exactly equal to the difference between domestic saving and domestic investment.\nIn fact, it is often instructive in longer-term analysis to view our current account in terms of its domestic\ncounterparts.\nAs I pointed out in a speech last November,3 virtually all of our trading partners share our inclination to\ninvest a disproportionate percentage of domestic savings in domestic capital assets, irrespective of\ntheir differential rates of return. People seem to prefer to invest in familiar local businesses even where\ncurrency and country risks do not exist. For the United States, studies have shown that individual\ninvestors and even professional money managers have a slight preference for investments in their\nown communities and states. Trust, so crucial an aspect of investing, is most likely to be fostered by\nthe familiarity of local communities.\nAs a consequence, \"home bias\" will likely continue to constrain the movement of world savings into its\noptimum use as capital investment, thus limiting the internationalization of financial intermediation and\nhence the growth of external assets and liabilities and the dispersion of world current account\nbalances that such growth implies.\nNonetheless, during the past decade, home bias has apparently declined significantly. For most of the\nearlier post World War II era, the correlation between domestic saving rates and domestic investment\nrates across the world's major economies, a conventional measure of home bias, was exceptionally\nhigh.4 For the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(OECD) , the GDP-weighted correlation coefficient was 0.97 in 1970. However, it fell from 0.96 in 1992\nto less than 0.8 in 2002. For OECD countries excluding the United States, the recent decline is even\nmore pronounced. These declines, not surprisingly, mirror the rise in the differences between saving\nand investment or, equivalently, of the dispersion of current account balances over the same years.\nThe decline in home bias probably reflects an increased international tendency for financial systems to\nbe more transparent, open, and supportive of strong investor protection.5 Moreover, vast\nimprovements in information and communication technologies have broadened investors' vision to the\npoint that foreign investment appears less exotic and risky. Accordingly, the trend of declining home\nbias and expanding international financial intermediation will likely continue. This process has enabled\nthe United States to incur and finance a much larger current account deficit than would have been\nfeasible in earlier decades. It is quite difficult to contemplate foreign savings in an amount equivalent\nto 5 percent of U.S. GDP being transferred to the United States two or three decades ago.\n* * *\nIt is unclear whether the burden of servicing our growing external liabilities or the rising weight of U.S.\nassets in global portfolios will impose the greater restraint on current account dispersion over the\nlonger term. Either way, when that point arrives, will the process of reining in our current account\ndeficit be benign to the economies of the United States and the world?\nAccording to a Federal Reserve staff study, current account deficits that emerged among developed\ncountries since 1980 have risen as high as double-digit percentages of GDP before markets enforced\na reversal.6 The median high has been about 5 percent of GDP.\nComplicating the evaluation of the timing of a turnaround is that deficit countries, both developed and\nemerging, borrow in international markets largely in dollars rather than in their domestic currency. The\nUnited States has been rare in its ability to finance its external deficit in a reserve currency. This ability\nhas presumably enlarged the capability of the United States relative to most of our trading partners to\nincur foreign debt.\nBesides experiences with the current account deficits of other countries, there are few useful\nguideposts of how high our country's net foreign liabilities can mount. The foreign accumulation of U.S.\nassets would likely slow if dollar assets, irrespective of their competitive return, came to occupy too\nlarge a share of the world's portfolio of store of value assets. In these circumstances, investors would\nseek greater diversification in non-dollar assets. At the end of 2002, U.S. dollars accounted for about\n65 percent of the foreign exchange reserves of foreign monetary authorities, with the euro second at\n19 percent. Approximately half of private cross-border holdings were denominated in dollars, with\none-third in euros.\n* * *\nMore important than the way that the adjustment of the U.S. current account deficit will be initiated is\nthe effect of the adjustment on both our economy and the economies of our trading partners. The\nhistory of such adjustments has been mixed. According to the aforementioned Federal Reserve study\nof current account corrections in developed countries, although the large majority of episodes were\ncharacterized by some significant slowing of economic growth, most economies managed the\nadjustment without crisis. The institutional strengths of many of these developed economies - rule of\nlaw, transparency, and investor and property protection - likely helped to minimize disruptions\nassociated with current account adjustments. The United Kingdom, however, had significant\nadjustment difficulties in its early postwar years, as did, more recently, Mexico, Thailand, Korea,\nRussia, Brazil, and Argentina, to name just a few.\nCan market forces incrementally defuse a worrisome buildup in a nation's current account deficit and\nnet external debt before a crisis more abruptly does so? The answer seems to lie with the degree of\nflexibility in both domestic and international markets. In domestic economies that approach full\nflexibility, imbalances are likely to be adjusted well before they become potentially destabilizing. In a\nsimilarly flexible world economy, as debt projections rise, product and equity prices, interest rates, and\nexchange rates could change, presumably to reestablish global balance.\nThe experience over the past two centuries of trade and finance among the individual states that make\nup the United States comes close to that paradigm of flexibility even though exchange rates among\nthe states have been fixed. Although we have scant data on cross-border transactions among the\nseparate states, anecdotal evidence suggests that over the decades significant apparent imbalances\nhave been resolved without precipitating interstate balance of payments crises. The dispersion of\nunemployment rates among the states, one measure of imbalances, spikes during periods of\neconomic stress but rapidly returns to modest levels, reflecting a high degree of adjustment flexibility.\nThat flexibility is even more apparent in regional money markets, where interest rates that presumably\nreflect differential imbalances in states' current accounts and hence cross-border borrowing\nrequirements have, in recent years, exhibited very little interstate dispersion. This observation\nsuggests either negligible cross-state-border imbalances, an unlikely occurrence given the pattern of\nstate unemployment dispersion, or more likely very rapid financial adjustments.\n* * *\nWe may not be able to usefully determine at what point foreign accumulation of net claims on the\nUnited States will slow or even reverse, but it is evident that the greater the degree of international\nflexibility, the less the risk of a crisis.7 The experience of the United States over the past three years is\nillustrative. The apparent ability of our economy to withstand a number of severe shocks since mid\n2000, with only a small decline in real GDP, attests to the marked increase in our economy's flexibility\nover the past quarter century.8\n* * *\nIn evaluating the nature of the adjustment process, we need to ask whether there is something special\nin the dollar being the world's primary reserve currency. With so few historical examples of dominant\nworld reserve currencies, we are understandably inclined to look to the experiences of the dollar's\nimmediate predecessor. At the height of sterling's role as the world's currency more than a century\nago, Great Britain had net external assets amounting to some 150 percent of its annual GDP, most of\nwhich were lost in World Wars I and II. Britain in the early post World War II period was hobbled with\nperiodic sterling crises when much of the remnants of Empire endeavored to disengage themselves\nfrom heavy reliance on holding sterling assets as central bank reserves and private stores of value.\nThe experience of Britain's then extensively regulated economy, harboring many wartime controls well\nbeyond the end of hostilities, provides testimony to the costs of structural rigidity in times of crisis.\n* * *\nShould globalization be allowed to proceed and thereby create an ever more flexible international\nfinancial system, history suggests that the odds are favorable that current imbalances will be defused\nwith little disruption to the economy or financial markets.\nBut there are other outcomes that are less benign, and we must endeavor to limit the likelihood of\nthese outcomes. One avenue by which to lessen the risk of a more difficult adjustment is for us to\nrestore fiscal discipline. The rise in national saving that would accompany a reduction in the federal\nbudget deficit will alleviate some of the burden of adjustment that would otherwise be required of the\nprivate sector through movements in asset prices.\nEven more worrisome than the lack of fiscal restraint are the clouds of emerging protectionism that\nhave become increasingly visible on today's horizon. Over the years, protected interests have often\nendeavored to stop in its tracks the process of unsettling economic change. Pitted against the\npowerful forces of market competition, virtually all such efforts have failed. The costs of any new such\nprotectionist initiatives, in the context of wide current account imbalances, could significantly erode the\nflexibility of the global economy. Consequently, it is imperative that creeping protectionism be thwarted\nand reversed.",

         "Alan Greenspan: Education\nTestimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, before the Committee on Education and the Workforce, US House of Representatives,\nWashington DC, 11 March 2004.\n* * *\nThe United States economy has long been characterized by a strong tradition of entrepreneurial spirit\namong our business people, a high level of skill among our workers, and an openness by firms and\nworkers alike to intense competition within and beyond our borders. Those attributes have given us a\nstandard of living unparalleled for so large a population - and one that has risen steadily over the\nhistory of our nation.\nBut with that bounty have also come the inevitable stresses and anxieties that accompany economic\nadvance. One concern that has persisted for some time is the fear that we are irreversibly losing\nmanufacturing jobs because of businesses' efforts to extract rapid gains in production efficiencies and\nto cut labor costs by tapping the lower-wage economies of Asia and Latin America.\nMore recently, similar concerns have arisen about the possibility that an increasing number of our\nbetter-paying white-collar jobs will be lost to outsourcing, especially to India and China. Many of these\njobs are in the service sector, and they were previously perceived as secure and largely free from the\ninternational competition long faced in the manufacturing sector. There is a palpable unease that\nbusinesses and jobs are being drained from the United States, with potentially adverse long-run\nimplications for employment and the standard of living of the average American. Job insecurity is\nunderstandably significant when nearly two million members of our workforce have been unemployed\nfor more than six months.\nThe issue is both important and sensitive, dealing as it does with the longer-term wealth of our nation\nand with the immediate welfare of so many individuals and communities. In the debate that has\nensued, a large gulf is often perceived between the arguments of economists, who almost always\npoint to the considerable benefits offered over the long term by exposure to free and open trade, and\nthe obvious stress felt by those caught on the downside of turbulence created by that exposure. It is\ncrucial that this gulf be bridged.\nAs history clearly shows, our economy is best served by full and vigorous engagement in the global\neconomy. Consequently, we need to increase our efforts to ensure that as many of our citizens as\npossible have the opportunity to capture the benefits that flow from that engagement. For reasons that\nI shall elucidate shortly, one critical element in creating that opportunity is the provision of rigorous\neducation and ongoing training to all members of our society. This proposal is not novel; it is, in fact,\nthe strategy that we have followed successfully for most of the past century and a strategy that we\nnow should embrace with renewed commitment.\nOver the long sweep of American generations and waves of economic change, we simply have not\nexperienced a net drain of jobs to advancing technology or to other nations. Since the end of World\nWar II, for example, the unemployment rate in the United States has averaged less than 6 percent with\nno apparent trend; and as recently as 2000, it dipped below 4 percent.\nMoreover, real earnings of the average worker have continued to rise. Over the past century, per\ncapita real income has risen at an average rate of more than 2 percent per year, declining notably only\nduring the Great Depression of the 1930s and immediately following World War II. Incomes trended\nhigher whether we had a trade deficit or a trade surplus and whether international outsourcing was\nlarge or small. More fundamental economic forces have apparently been at work. Research on wealth\ncreation in both emerging and developed nations strongly suggests that it is the knowledge and the\nskill of our population interacting under our rule of law that determine our real incomes, irrespective of\nthe specific jobs in which these incomes are earned and irrespective of the proportion of domestic\nconsumption met by imports.\nThese upward trends in the standard of living, however, mask the stress that significant parts of our\nworkforce endure. Joseph Schumpeter, the renowned Harvard professor, called the process of\nprogress \"creative destruction,\" the continuous scrapping of old technologies to make way for the new.\nStandards of living rise because the cash flows of industries employing older, increasingly\nobsolescent, technologies are marshaled, along with new savings, to finance the production of capital\nassets that almost always embody cutting-edge technologies. Workers migrate with the capital. This is\nthe process by which wealth is created, incremental step by incremental step.\nThe process of creative destruction has been accompanied by an ever-growing conceptualization of\neconomic output. Ideas rather than materials or physical brawn have been by far the greatest\ncontributors during the past half-century to our average annual increase of 3-1/4 percent in real gross\ndomestic product.\nTechnological advance is continually altering the shape, nature, and complexity of our economic\nprocesses. To effectively manage this ever-increasing complexity, our labor force has had to become\nmore and more technically oriented. Years of schooling, a rough proxy for skills, averaged nine and\none-quarter years in 1950. A half-century later, schooling averaged more than twelve years.\nAt the risk of some oversimplification, if the skill composition of our workforce meshed fully with the\nneeds of our increasingly complex capital stock, wage-skill differentials would be stable, and\npercentage changes in wage rates would be the same for all job grades. This was largely the case\nthrough the 1960s when the addition of skilled college graduates to the labor force, in part the result of\nschooling financed by the GI Bill, was sufficient to hold wage increases among the highly skilled to\naverage gains. Real wages of the lesser skilled also rose significantly, in part as a result of effective\nhigh-school educations and the many skills learned during the war. In the 1970s, the supply of skilled\nworkers received another boost from the rapid expansion of our nation's community colleges. In short,\ntechnical proficiencies across all job grade levels appeared to rise about in line with the needs of our,\neven then, complex stock of capital.\nBut for the past twenty years the real incomes of skilled, especially highly skilled, workers have risen\nmore than the average of all workers, whereas real wage rate increases for lesser-skilled workers\nhave been below average, indeed virtually nonexistent. This difference in wage trends suggests that,\nat least in relative terms, we have developed a shortage of highly skilled workers and a surplus of\nlesser-skilled workers.\nAlthough in recent years the proportion of our labor force made up of those with at least some college\neducation has continued to grow, we appear, nonetheless, to be graduating too few skilled workers to\naddress the apparent imbalance between the supply of such workers and the burgeoning demand for\nthem. Perhaps the accelerated pace of high-tech equipment installations associated with the large\nincreases in productivity growth in recent years is generating unachievable demands for skilled\ngraduates over the short run. If the apparent acceleration in the demand for skilled workers to staff our\nhigh-tech capital stock is temporary, as many presume, the pressure on our schools would ease as\nwould the upward pressure on high-skilled wages.\nMore broadly, in considering the issue of expanding our skilled workforce, some have a gnawing\nsense that our problems may be more than temporary and that the roots of the problem may extend\nback through our education system. Many of our students languish at too low a level of skill, and the\nresult is an apparent excess of supply relative to a declining demand. These changing balances are\nmost evident in the failure of real wages at the lower end of our income distribution to rise during the\npast quarter-century.\nThe hypothesis that we should be able to improve upon the knowledge that our students acquire as\nthey move from kindergarten to twelfth grade gains some support from international comparisons. A\nstudy conducted in 1995 revealed that, although our fourth-grade students were above average in\nboth math and science, by the time they reached their last year of high school they had fallen well\nbelow the international average.1 Accordingly, we apparently have quite a distance to go before we\ncatch up.\nEarly last century, technological advance required workers with a higher level of cognitive skills - for\ninstance the ability to read manuals, to interpret blueprints, or to understand formulas. Youth were\npulled from rural areas, where opportunities were limited, into more-productive occupations in\nbusiness and an advancing manufacturing sector. Our educational system responded: In the 1920s\nand 1930s, high-school enrollment in this country expanded rapidly. It became the job of these\ninstitutions to prepare students for work life. In the context of the demands of the economy at that time,\na high-school diploma represented the training needed to be successful in most aspects of American\nenterprise. The economic returns for having a high-school diploma rose and, as a result, high-school\nenrollment rates climbed.\nBy the time that the United States entered World War II, the median level of education for a\nseventeen-year-old was a high-school diploma - an accomplishment that set us apart from other\ncountries. I cannot dismiss the notion that we can learn something from that period and perhaps from\nother countries. Still, I realize that the world was different from today in many ways. Societal changes\nhave been numerous and profound, and our schools are being asked to do a great deal more than\nthey have in the past. We need to be forward-looking in order to adapt our educational system to the\nevolving needs of the economy and the realities of our changing society.\nOne area in which educational investments appear to have paid off is our community colleges. These\ntwo-year institutions are playing a similar role in preparing our students for work life as did our early\ntwentieth-century high schools in that less technically oriented era. But to an even greater extent, our\npopulation today is adjusting to an ever-faster turnover of jobs. We are also growing more aware that\nin the current intensely competitive economy, the pace of job creation and destruction implies that the\naverage work life will span many jobs and even more than one profession.\nThe desire of workers to learn skills that build on their previous work experiences or to acquire new\nskills is apparent. Currently almost one in three of the enrollees in community colleges and almost one\nof two part-time enrollees at four-year undergraduate schools are aged thirty or older, statistics that\nsuggest that these individuals have had previous job experience. The increase in these enrollments\nover the past thirty years attests to the success of these institutions in imparting both general and\npractical job-related training. A rising proportion of the population is also taking advantage of\nworkrelated instruction.\nMore broadly, our system of higher education bears an important responsibility for ensuring that our\nworkforce is prepared for the demands of economic change. America's reputation as the world's\nleader in higher education is grounded in the ability of these versatile institutions to serve the practical\nneeds of the economy by teaching and training and, more significantly, by unleashing the creative\nthinking that moves our economy forward.\n* * *\nI do not doubt that the vast majority of us would prefer to work in a less stressful, less competitive\nenvironment. Yet, in our roles as consumers, we seem to relentlessly seek the low product prices and\nhigh quality that are prominent features of our current frenetically competitive economic structure.\nRetailers who do not choose their suppliers, foreign or domestic, with price and quality uppermost in\nmind, risk losing their customers to retailers who do. Retailers are afforded little leeway in product\nsourcing. If consumers are stern taskmasters of their marketplace, business purchasers of capital\nequipment and production materials inputs have taken the competitive paradigm a step further and\napplied it on a global scale.\nThose who have lost jobs as a consequence of this process, I know, are not readily consoled by the\nfact that job insecurity concerns are not new. But keeping the current period in context is instructive.\nJobs in the United States were perceived as migrating to low-wage Japan in the 1950s and 1960s, to\nlow-wage Mexico in the 1990s, and most recently to low-wage China. Japan, of course, is no longer\ncharacterized by a low-wage workforce, and many in Mexico are now complaining of job losses to\nlow-wage China.\nIn response to these strains and the dislocations they cause, a new round of protectionist steps is\nbeing proposed. These alleged cures would make matters worse rather than better. They would do\nlittle to create jobs; and if foreigners were to retaliate, we would surely lose jobs. Besides enhancing\neducation, we need to further open markets here and abroad to allow our workers to compete\neffectively in the global marketplace.\n* * *\nAs our economy exhibits increasing signals of recovery, job loss continues to diminish. But new job\ncreation is lagging badly - the ironic consequence of accelerated gains in productivity. In all likelihood,\nemployment will begin to increase more quickly before long as output continues to expand. We have\nreason to be confident that new jobs will displace old ones as they always have, but America's\njob-turnover process will never be without pain for those caught on the downside of creative\ndestruction.\nWe do have a choice. We can erect walls to foreign trade and even discourage job-displacing\ninnovation. The pace of competition would surely slow, and tensions might appear to ease. But only\nfor a short while. Our standard of living would soon begin to stagnate and perhaps even decline as a\nconsequence. Time and again through our history, we have discovered that attempting merely to\npreserve the comfortable features of the present, rather than reaching for new levels of prosperity, is a\nsure path to stagnation.\nIn closing, I have emphasized the importance of redressing the apparent imbalances between the\nsupply and demand for labor across the spectrum of skills. Those imbalances have the potential to\nhamper the adjustment flexibility of our economy overall. But these growing imbalances are also\naggravating the inequality of incomes in this country.\nHistorically, we have placed much greater emphasis on the need to provide equality of opportunity\nthan on equality of outcomes. But equal opportunity requires equal access to knowledge. We cannot\nexpect everyone to be equally skilled. But we need to pursue equal access to knowledge to ensure\nthat our economic system works at maximum efficiency and is perceived as just in its distribution of\nrewards.",

         "Alan Greenspan: Banking\nRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, before the Independent Community Bankers of America Convention, San Diego (via satellite),\n17 March 2004.\n* * *\nIt is a pleasure once again to participate in the annual meeting of the Independent Community\nBankers Association. I particularly hoped to attend this meeting in person, but events made such a trip\ninfeasible.\nI wanted to be at your meeting to join in honoring the contributions of Ken Guenther. As everyone\nknows who has ever received Ken's notes - known fondly to one and all as \"Guenther-grams\" - he\nthinks deeply and broadly about banking and financial matters.\nHaving reflected on the kinds of issues that Ken has on his mind, I thought it would be fitting today if I\nshared with you some ideas about where the banking industry is today and about a few trends we see\nevolving.\nAsset growth and quality\nThe weakness in credit quality that accompanied the recent recession has clearly been mild for the\nbanking system as a whole, and the system remains strong and well positioned to meet customer\nneeds for credit and other financial services. During the past three years or so, the industry extended\nits string of high and often record quarterly earnings, retained its historically high equity and risk-based\ncapital ratios, and generally enjoyed robust asset growth. The industry and its supervisors had begun\nexceptionally early to address slippage in credit standards that accompanied the maturing of the last\nexpansion, and their timely intervention was reflected in modest subsequent write-offs relative to\nearnings. Indeed, for each of the past several quarters the volume of problem assets at commercial\nbanks has declined, and the size and the number of bank failures in recent years have been\nexceptionally small.\nAlthough the demand for business loans has remained weak, the banking industry has continued to\nbenefit from strong demand for household credit, not least for residential mortgage products. The\noutlook for asset quality is also favorable. As economic activity continues to grow and businesses\nbecome more confident about their customers' demands, business loan demand should increase, and\npressures on banking margins should begin to ease.\nDuring the period of weakness and recovery, quite a large amount of core deposits flowed back into\nbanks of all sizes reflecting lower interest rates on alternative assets, the softness of the stock market,\nand the public's desire for safe assets. As a result, banks had ample liquidity and the resources to\nfund asset growth. More recently, with renewed interest in market securities and a slowing of\nmortgage re-financings - and their associated buildup in deposits - core deposits have weakened.\nHistory suggests that, as the economy strengthens further, deposit substitutes again will become more\nattractive to bank customers, requiring competitive responses in bank deposit offering rates and\nreliance on non-core sources. Community bankers in the last half of the nineties demonstrated their\nskill in competing successfully in such markets.\nAlthough their deposit patterns have been similar, community and larger banks have seen some\ninteresting differences developing in their portfolios in the past two or three years that are worth noting.\nBanking commentary generally has emphasized the extent to which residential mortgage finance and\nconsumer credit extensions have dominated the portfolio expansion of the banking industry. In fact,\nthat growth, which dominates the aggregate statistics, has been mainly a large bank phenomenon.\nAt community banks, the residential mortgage, credit card, and consumer installment loan portfolios\nhave declined in each of the last three years. To be sure, this change may be a matter of choice. The\ndata suggest, for example, that community banks have originated a significant volume of mortgage\nloans for securitization by others, continuing to acquire in the process a large amount of\nmortgagebacked securities. But some observers have noted that in the market for new originations of\nmortgages community banks are also under continued competitive pressure from mortgage bankers,\nnationwide mortgage lenders, and real estate agent relationships with out-of-market lenders, often\nthrough the Internet.\nThe declining importance of traditional consumer credit business at community banks appears to stem\nfrom both sustained competition from captive finance companies and community banks' withdrawal\nfrom the credit card market, where significant scale is required to service the resultant portfolios.\nCommunity bankers, however, continue to have success with home equity loans as a substitute for\nmore traditional consumer lending and have experienced growth in such loans comparable to that at\nlarger institutions.\nParticularly noteworthy is the longer-term trend at community banks that seems to have accelerated in\nthe past three years - the increasing share of asset growth accounted for by nonresidential real estate\nfinance, particularly construction and land development loans and commercial and industrial real\nestate financing. Last year these categories accounted for more than 90 percent of the net asset\ngrowth of banks with less than $1 billion in assets; multifamily real estate and farmland finance would\nbring the total to more than 100 percent, offsetting the declines in other categories.\nSuch credit exposures are a natural evolution of community banking and are quite profitable, helping\nto sustain both the earnings and growing equity capital of community banks. Moreover, the evidence\nsuggests that community banks have avoided the underwriting mistakes that led to so many problems\nten to fifteen years ago. Borrower equity is much higher and credit criteria are much stricter. In the last\nrecession and during the early weak recovery, we saw very few delinquencies in these credits.\nNonetheless, bankers need to be aware of the historical real estate cycle that, in the past, placed such\nexposures under severe stress. One hopes these improvements in underwriting standards are lasting.\nBut the painful lessons of banking history underscore the ever-present need for vigilance in managing\ngeographic and business line concentrations.\nConsolidation\nMergers and acquisitions in banking continue, driven by technology, reduced barriers to entry,\nrelaxation of interstate banking restrictions, and globalization. Although attention has been focused on\nthe larger banks, roughly 90 percent of mergers over the past decade have involved a target with less\nthan $1 billion; three-quarters have involved an acquiree with assets of less than $250 million. Largely\nas a consequence, the number of banking organizations with assets of less than $1 billion has fallen\nsince the mid-1990s by more than one-fifth.\nNeither the aggregate decline in the number of banking organizations of all sizes nor the increase in\naggregate concentration ratios tells us much about the competitive effects of consolidation.\nCompetition in banking is fought on the battlefield of the local market, especially for households and\nsmall and medium-sized businesses. By that test, concentration in local markets has actually declined\nsomewhat since the mid-1990s in both urban and rural local markets. The apparent contradiction\nbetween aggregate consolidation and the virtually unchanged local market structure reflects the fact\nthat many of the mergers and acquisitions by all sizes of banks have been out-of-market, or\ngeographic-expansion, mergers. In addition, when consolidation occurs, it often induces de novo entry\nto take advantage of the inefficiencies or transition difficulties of the newly consolidated enterprise.\nOver the past five years, for every four bank mergers that have been approved, three de novo bank\ncharters have been granted.\nTo be sure, expansion by large banks through acquisitions and branching has increased the number\nof local markets - urban and rural - in which a large institution is a rival. Last year, 99 percent of the\nurban markets and 54 percent of the rural markets had an office of a banking organization with\ndeposits of $25 billion or more. Such an increase in the presence of large banking organizations at the\nlocal level has occurred while community banks continue to face competition from thrifts, credit unions,\nsecurities firms, and loan production offices from out-of-market lenders, not to mention the Internet.\nThese trends are irreversible. Nonetheless, as evidenced by their performance, community banks\nhave the competitive skill of innovation and the competitive edge of local market knowledge not just to\nsurvive against such competition but to continue to prosper.\nBasel II\nEvery indication to date also suggests that the proposed application of Basel II in the United States to\nonly large banks should not be a matter of concern to community bankers. Indeed, your comments on\nour proposal to revise the Basel Accord suggest that you are comfortable, to say the least, with not\nhaving to invest in the institutional infrastructure to be required of the largest banks. The agencies\nbelieve that the generally strong capital position and straightforward balance sheets of most of the\nother banks make a wider application of Basel II neither cost effective nor necessary on prudential\ngrounds. Of course, supervisors will continue reviewing credit-granting and risk-management policies\nat banks of all sizes, and I suspect that, in the years ahead, market-driven spin-offs from the new\nprocedures at larger banks will be adopted by community banks.\nApparently another fear exists. The comments received from some of you indicated a concern that\nperhaps the lower regulatory capital that some large banks may incur under Basel II on some\nportfolios may distort the competitive balance between adopters and non-adopters of the proposed\nnew accord. The banking agencies and the Congress take such risks seriously. Indeed, we have\nindicated that if we see evidence supporting competitive distortions, we will make the necessary\nmodifications to blunt them by doing one of the following: changing Basel II rules in the United States,\nwhere national discretion is allowed; modifying the proposed U.S. bifurcated application; or changing\nthe capital rules that apply to non-adopters. In short, if we have evidence of a potential competitive\nproblem, we will not be precluded from proposing any measure that we believe is necessary to retain a\nmore level playing field.\nTwo weeks ago, the Federal Reserve published the first two of four empirical studies on this issue that\nour staff is conducting. One addresses the concern that regulatory capital reductions at adopters of\nBasel II might induce more mergers and acquisitions, with the adopters acquiring the non-adopters.\nThat paper finds little empirical evidence that, in the past, excess regulatory capital at the acquirer had\nbeen a significant factor in boosting consolidation.\nThe second paper evaluates the fear that the lower on average, risk-based capital charges on loans to\nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises by Basel II adopters would put non-adopters at a competitive\ndisadvantage. This study concludes that the empirical evidence suggests that, indeed, a competitive\nissue in this market might arise between adopters and large bank non-adopters, both of which make\nthe same types of loans in the same markets. This potential effect must be addressed. But the study\nalso concludes that, on the basis of empirical review, the types of small business loans generally\nmade by community banks - relationship-based loans, which community banks do so well - are so\ndifferent from the types of loans made by larger banks, and so differently priced, that the competitive\neffects on community banks of Basel II application to large banks are likely to be insignificant.\nTwo other studies, exploring the competitive effects in the residential mortgage and credit card\nmarkets will be available in the next few months. The results of all four studies will be reviewed when\nwe conduct later this year another Quantitative Impact Study on the revised Basel II now being\ndeveloped. And, again, if updates of the completed studies or the analyses in the new studies\ndemonstrate competitive problems, we will modify the proposals to address them.\nSummary\nIn summary, the banking system is in a strong and profitable position to finance the credit demands of\nthe current expansion. As that expansion continues, both large and community banks will have to\nonce again look beyond their core deposit base to fund those demands. The competitive environment\nfor banks, especially community banks, will continue to intensify. Both history and current behavior\nsuggest, however, that community banks can innovate and meet these competitive challenges. The\nmerger trends of both large and small banks will undoubtedly continue, but both public policy and new\nentry will also continue to limit concentration in local markets. If evidence shows that a bifurcated\napplication of Basel II would distort competitive markets in the United States, the agencies are pledged\nto make whatever modifications are necessary to either the proposal or the current capital rules. And,\nfinally, once again: Ken, I wish you a productive and enjoyable retirement.",

         "Donald L Kohn: Monetary policy in a time of macroeconomic transition\nRemarks by Mr Donald L Kohn, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the 2004 Washington Economic Policy Conference, presented by the National Association\nfor Business Economics (NABE) and the Association for University Business and Economic Research\n(AUBER), Washington, DC, 25 March 2004.\n* * *\nThe current stance of monetary policy is highly accommodative. With the target level of the nominal\nfederal funds rate at a historically low 1 percent and inflation running at a similar rate, the real funds\nrate is around zero. Low short-term interest rates, in turn, have held down longer-term rates, raised\nasset prices, and fostered an improvement in financial conditions more generally.\nThis policy stance was adopted, as you know, in response to a sharp retrenchment in aggregate\ndemand during the past few years. As a consequence of weak output, declining employment, and a\ndecrease in core inflation to a low level, the Federal Reserve eased policy aggressively. The intended\nfunds rate fell from 6-1/2 percent in late 2000 to less than 2 percent in late 2001, and then to just\n1 percent by the middle of 2003.\nI anticipate that a principal challenge facing the Federal Reserve in coming years will be to return\nmonetary policy from its current, stimulative stance to a more neutral posture in a way that will\npromote full employment while maintaining price stability. In doing so, we will need to assess and\nrespond to three interrelated transitions: the transition of aggregate demand from weakness to solid\ngrowth; the transition of the growth of potential supply from extraordinary to merely rapid; and the\ntransition from disinflation to a more balanced price outlook. The nature of these transitions and the\nrisks around them are likely to define the future policy environment. Today I plan to examine these\ntransitions and then discuss some of their possible implications for the strategy of monetary policy. I\nshould emphasize that these are my own thoughts and views; I am not speaking for my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\nThe transition from weakness to solid growth of aggregate demand\nDuring the past several years, a confluence of forces restrained aggregate demand. After the\ninvestment boom of the 1990s, firms reassessed their need for capital and sharply cut back\ninvestment spending. Reinforcing this tendency to curtail capital outlays was a deterioration in the\nfinancial conditions of businesses: Profits sagged and decreasing equity prices and widening risk\nspreads inhibited access to external funds. Heightened geopolitical risks after the terrorist attacks of\nSeptember 11 and in the run-up to the Iraq war added to businesses' caution.\nIn the last several quarters, these restraining forces have been abating. The excess physical capital\nthat had developed earlier appears to have been worked off in most sectors, and the need to replace\nolder equipment has become more pressing. At the same time, the financial condition of businesses\nhas improved considerably; their profitability and cash flow have surged, and low interest rates have\nfacilitated a restructuring of their balance sheets.\nEquity valuations have also turned around. After dropping roughly 50 percent between early 2000 and\nlate 2002, the Wilshire 5000 has now reversed nearly half of that decline. Investor confidence seems\nto have recovered, at least somewhat, from the corporate governance and accounting scandals\nrevealed in 2002 and 2003. With house prices rising as well, household wealth has been increasing\nagain, and more rapidly than income. Clearly, geopolitical risks persist, but not to the nearly paralyzing\ndegree seen earlier.\nAs a consequence, aggregate demand has strengthened considerably, aided greatly by stimulative\nfiscal and monetary policies. Reductions in personal taxes have supported disposable income despite\na lagging labor market. In addition, the partial-expensing provision for new business equipment is\nlowering the cost of capital and thereby likely boosting investment spending. The accommodative\nstance of monetary policy has raised the prices of assets on household balance sheets and lowered\nthe cost of acquiring houses and durable goods, while also reducing the cost of capital for businesses\nand helping them to strengthen their financial positions.\nLooking ahead, the prospects for growth in household and business spending seem bright. Rising\nenergy prices and a heightening of concerns about global terrorism appear to have eroded some of\nthe optimism of late last year without as yet undermining the forward thrust of the economy. Consumer\noutlays held up well in late 2003 and have increased so far in 2004 despite surprising and troubling\nweakness in labor markets. For reasons I will come back to later, I anticipate that labor demand will\nbegin to strengthen noticeably in coming quarters. The accompanying lift to personal income should\nlend support to future household spending, even as the impetus from the tax cuts to consumption\ngrowth diminishes. Business purchases of equipment and software rose more than 15 percent at an\nannual rate in the second half of 2003, and recent data on orders and shipments of capital goods point\nto another large gain in the first quarter. Investment should continue to be spurred by several factors:\nthe accelerator effects of sales growth, favorable cash flow and financial conditions, ongoing\nopportunities to upgrade capital stocks with new technologies, and for this year, partial expensing.\nMeanwhile, the decline in the dollar over the past two years and faster growth among our trading\npartners suggest that less of the strengthening of our domestic demand will be met by higher imports\nthan it would be otherwise, and that rising exports will help to stimulate production in the United\nStates. Indeed, the global nature of the pickup in economic activity encourages me to think that we are\nseeing a fundamental turnaround in confidence and spending propensities that is likely to be\nself-reinforcing.\nAll told, the U.S. economy has apparently made the transition from weakness to solid growth.\nHowever, even if these positive signs are borne out, the path of economic expansion will undoubtedly\nbe uneven, and significant risks remain. One downside risk lies in spending by the household sector.\nPurchases of new houses and durable goods have boomed over the past several years, raising the\nstocks of those capital goods in the hands of households. In addition, the saving rate is very low by\nhistorical standards. I expect that the growth in household investment will taper off, but a more\npronounced pullback in spending cannot be ruled out, especially once interest rates rise. Some\nobservers have expressed concern that weakness in hiring, should it persist, would hold down the\ngrowth of labor income and weigh on consumer confidence, and thus could depress spending at some\npoint. In recent quarters, however, slow hiring has been accompanied by strong productivity growth.\nOver time, higher productivity will show up in higher wages. But even in the short-run, these new\nefficiencies have boosted capital income, and the resulting increases in dividend income and stock\nprices have, in the aggregate, provided at least a partial offset to restrained growth of wages and\nsalaries.\nOn the upside, business spending could turn out to be even more robust than I expect. Businesses'\ncaution about making commitments to meet future demand appears still to be eroding only slowly.\nShould confidence return more quickly, we could see a more marked strengthening in capital\nspending, inventory accumulation, and hiring.\nThe transition from extraordinary to merely rapid growth of potential aggregate supply\nThe transition to more-rapid and self-sustaining increases in aggregate demand is critical to the\noutlook, but it is only part of the story. The full tale also requires an assessment of the economy's\nproductive potential - both its level and its rate of growth. Unfortunately, potential supply cannot be\nobserved directly, and inferring its behavior from variables that can be observed is a daunting task. But\nthe task is essential nonetheless: Changes in potential supply have been among the most important\ninfluences on the behavior of the economy over the past ten years.\nI should note that the course of aggregate demand is not independent of the course of potential\naggregate supply. Both economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that households and\nbusinesses make decisions about spending with an eye to future incomes and sales, so that a rosier\nlong-term outlook tends to raise demand today. Thus, as the FOMC notes frequently in its statements,\nrobust underlying growth in productivity is providing ongoing support to economic activity.\nNevertheless, owing to the restraints that I spoke of earlier, demand has fallen well short of potential\nsupply during the past several years, as can be seen in the elevated unemployment rate, the\ndepressed rate of capacity utilization, and the decline in inflation.\nCertainly, potential supply appears to have increased at an extraordinary rate in recent years, even\ncompared with the accelerated pace of the late 1990s. Between 1973 and 1995, labor productivity in\nthe nonfarm business sector increased at an annual average rate of 1-1/2 percent; between 1995 and\n2000, productivity climbed 2-1/2 percent per year; and since 2000, productivity has jumped more than\n4 percent per year on average. Understanding the reasons for this surge is critical to judging the likely\npath of productivity and potential supply going forward.\nSome of the step-up in productivity growth since 2000 probably reflects cyclical influences or factors\nthat may offer only one-time improvements in the production process. For example, businesses' ability\nto find efficiencies on such a large scale in recent years probably stems in part from learning how to\ntake better advantage of the large amount of capital equipment and new technology that they acquired\nin the late 1990s. Moreover, in the past few years businesses have displayed unusual caution in their\ndecisions not only about investment in capital goods but also about hiring. As firms have focused on\ncontrolling costs in an uncertain environment, they have naturally tried to avoid taking on new workers\nand have tried instead to extract the greatest possible output from their existing workforces. To the\nextent that these processes have revealed inefficiencies in production, they have raised the level of\nproductivity on a permanent basis; however, they are unlikely to be a source of continued productivity\ngains.\nAll that said, some of the recent step-up in productivity growth may well persist. Rapid technological\nchange and continued declines in the cost of high-tech equipment should enable more substantial\nefficiency gains in a wide array of industries. Moreover, healthy profits and low borrowing costs should\nencourage firms to acquire new capital assets, which will give workers more and better equipment to\nuse and thus make them more productive. Taken together, these arguments suggest that productivity\nwill continue to advance at a rapid rate, but not at the extraordinary pace of recent years. This\ntransition, combined with solid growth in aggregate demand, should result in stronger hiring and a\nnarrowing of the output gap.\nAs with the transition in demand, the transition to less-spectacular growth of potential supply involves\nimportant risks. We have been persistently surprised by the extent of the pickup in productivity and\ncould be facing a higher level and growth rate of productivity than many expect. If we are so fortunate\nas to be confronting these circumstances, policymakers will need to be alert to the need for a faster\nexpansion of aggregate demand to match the stepped-up pace of supply. Conversely, perhaps the\ntransitory factors boosting productivity will recede more sharply than most observers anticipate, and\nthe output gap will close more rapidly. It appears to me that uncertainty in our current situation is at\nleast as great for potential output as it is for demand.\nThe transition from disinflation to more balanced risks for inflation\nLet me turn now to the implications of these demand and supply transitions for inflation. Over the past\nseveral years, slack in resource utilization and declining unit labor costs owing to rapid productivity\ngrowth have reduced the inflation rate. The chain-weighted price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures increased more than 2 percent in the four quarters of 2000, but it rose only 1-1/2 percent\nlast year. PCE inflation excluding food and energy items has eased a similar amount, with core prices\nrising 1-1/2 percent in 2000 but just 1 percent last year. The CPI and core CPI show even steeper\ndecelerations than do PCE prices.\nMoreover, leaving aside the reduction in inflation, the level of core inflation is now quite low - in the\nneighborhood of 1 percent when measured by either the CPI or the PCE price index. Allowing for\nmeasurement biases in these series, the U.S. economy has entered a zone of price stability. Indeed,\nlast spring the FOMC noted the risk that, for the first time in forty years, inflation in the United States\nmight fall too low.\nThe incoming data contain some indications that underlying inflation is no longer declining, but the\nevidence is inconclusive thus far. In particular, recent monthly changes in core prices have been within\nthe range of increases seen in 2003, but this flattening out of inflation has not persisted long enough to\nbe clearly distinguished from the normal volatility in these data. Still, if aggregate demand and\npotential aggregate supply follow the paths that I outlined earlier, the slack in resource utilization\nshould diminish, unit labor costs should begin to move higher, and the underlying rate of inflation\nshould stabilize.\nSources of potential upward pressure on prices have become more prominent in recent months.\nOverall inflation has been boosted by a jump in energy prices. Such a jump could raise core inflation\ntemporarily if it is passed through to other prices or if it contributes to increasing inflation expectations.\nIndeed, by several measures, near-term inflation expectations have risen of late. However, futures\nmarket participants have priced in some decline in energy prices from these elevated levels; and even\nif energy prices remain high, they would not be adding to inflation over time.\nAnother factor some observers have cited as possibly boosting inflation is a tendency for increases in\nresource utilization to generate bottlenecks that can push up some prices more rapidly. Indeed,\nperiods like the current one with rising global demand have often been accompanied by marked\naccelerations in the prices of crude and, to a lesser extent, intermediate materials, which seem to be\nmost sensitive to changes in demand. But this variation in upstream producer prices has left little\nimprint on consumer prices in the past - perhaps because these inputs account for a small share of the\nfinal value of industrial output and even less of total consumption. A related concern is the effect of a\ndeclining dollar on import prices and the prices of competing domestic goods. Over time, however,\nforeign producers seem to be absorbing a greater share of the impact of a falling dollar in their profit\nmargins rather than passing it on fully in their prices, and I expect the drop in the dollar to have only a\nmodest effect on U.S. inflation.\nAt the same time, other forces are likely to be acting to restrain inflation. Importantly, slack in resource\nutilization will probably be eliminated only gradually, so competition for jobs and for market share\nshould remain intense. In addition, because hourly compensation has lagged productivity, unit labor\ncosts have fallen markedly. The resulting markup of prices over unit labor costs is quite elevated,\nfurther encouraging firms to reach for market share as well as providing scope for workers' real wages\nto rise without pushing up inflation.\nOverall, the tenor of the inflation outlook has shifted over recent quarters. Solid growth in economic\nactivity, higher prices in some sectors, and hints of the stabilization of overall inflation, along with\nperceptions by businesses that \"pricing power\" may be returning, are marking a transition from\nasymmetric risks of additional disinflation to more nearly balanced risks of rising and falling inflation.\nThis transition is another key piece of the backdrop for monetary policy.\nMonetary policy strategy\nAs I noted at the outset of my talk, the federal funds rate is quite low: It is low relative to interest rates\nassociated in the past with sustained high employment and stable prices; and it is low relative to\nrecent rates of economic growth - a disparity that has attracted increasing attention from some\nobservers. In fact, the low funds rate has been necessary to promote growth that, to date, has been\njust sufficient to begin reducing substantial margins of slack in resource utilization. Still, as my analysis\nindicates, the unusual shocks that have impinged on demand and bolstered potential supply over the\npast several years are abating, or should soon do so. As the output gap closes, economic stability will\nrequire that interest rates eventually move up from unusually low levels if we are to preserve price\nstability.\nThe FOMC stated again last week that it believes it can be patient in removing its policy\naccommodation. One set of reasons for patience in my view can be found in the levels of inflation and\nresource utilization likely to prevail for a while. As I have already noted, a considerable gap exists\ntoday between actual and potential output, and consumer price inflation is very low. In addition, the\ntransitions I have discussed in aggregate demand, potential aggregate supply, and inflation are\ngradual processes. The move to solid growth of demand and some easing in the growth of potential\nsupply are unlikely to lead to a rapid closing of the gaps in resource utilization or a marked rise in\ninflation.\nThe risks around the likely course of the economy, and the costs and benefits of erring to one side or\nthe other of the anticipated outcomes, also support a strategy of patience. Given our uncertainty about\nthe rate of growth of potential supply, actually observing a closing output gap will be particularly\nimportant for policymakers. Given our uncertainty about the level of potential supply and thus the level\nof the output gap, observing stable inflation will also be particularly important. Moreover, the low\ncurrent levels of inflation and resource utilization imply, from my perspective, that the welfare costs of\nthe economy running stronger than expected for a while are considerably lower than the costs of its\nrunning weaker. In these circumstances, I think policy action can await convincing evidence that labor\nmarket slack is on a declining trend and that inflation is no longer decreasing.\nI would note that patience in policy action can take several forms. One form would be to wait before\ntaking any action; another would be a damped trajectory for the funds rate once tightening begins. A\nmore gradual increase that begins sooner might enable the Federal Reserve to better gauge the\nfinancial and economic response to its actions and reduce the odds that a sharp tightening tack would\nbe required at some point to prevent the economy's overshooting. However, this approach might also\nrun a larger risk of prematurely truncating the expansion - especially if markets interpret the first\ntightening move as presaging a rapid return to a so-called neutral policy. Undoubtedly, the FOMC will\nchoose a strategy that does not fit neatly into any box, but these considerations will likely play a role in\nour deliberations.\nSome observers argue that the Federal Reserve has already been too patient. They are concerned\nthat continued policy accommodation is distorting interest rates and asset prices and encouraging a\nbuild-up of debt, and thereby laying the groundwork for financial and economic instability. Clearly, the\nlow funds rate has held down long-term interest rates and boosted asset prices. These movements\nare, in fact, some of the key channels through which monetary policy has stimulated demand. Whether\nprices in some markets have gone beyond what one might have expected from easier monetary policy\nis unclear. When interest rates increase, prices will undoubtedly adjust to some extent - in some cases\nsimply by rising less rapidly than they would otherwise - and debt-service obligations will move up.\nHouseholds, businesses, and financial institutions need to be prepared for this adjustment. But I think\nthe hurdle is high - and appropriately so - for a central bank to tighten policy, and in the process damp\nan expansion of economic activity in the short run, on the suspicion that movements in asset prices\nand increases in debt threaten economic stability over the longer run.\nConclusion\nIn sum, monetary policy will be facing some interesting challenges over the next several years, even if\nthe economy proceeds along the favorable path I have outlined today. And, as all forecasters know,\nthe odds are always high that events will deviate from our expectations, requiring policy to adapt. Still,\nthe challenges are likely to be more favorable than those presented by the economic weakness of the\npast few years. The economy seems to be on a path toward higher levels of output and stable prices.\nThe Federal Reserve will be trying to do its part to foster these welcome developments.",

         "Timothy F Geithner: Change and challenges facing the US financial system\nRemarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York, before the New York Bankers Association's Annual Financial Services Forum,\nNew York, 25 March 2004.\n* * *\nIt is a pleasure to join you at the New York Bankers Association Financial Services Forum. The\ninstitutions represented in this room, together with the rest of the New York financial community,\nremain at the center of the U.S. and global financial systems.\nYour meeting today takes place against the backdrop of a relatively favorable national and global\neconomic outlook. The U.S. financial system is in reasonably strong shape. Financial innovation has\nenabled substantial improvements in the quality of risk management and in the capacity of the system\nto handle shocks. But the benefits of innovation have come with significant challenges to the people\nwho run financial institutions and to those responsible for supervision and oversight. How effective we\nare in responding to these challenges will determine whether the U.S. financial system is as\nsuccessful in the future as it has been in the past.\nThe consensus forecast for the U.S. economy expects solid growth this year and next, somewhat\nabove the upper bound of the range of most estimates of U.S. potential growth. Confidence in the\nsustainability of the U.S. expansion, as measured by changes in these forecasts, for example, seems\nto be increasing. The rate of economic growth outside the United States is also looking better.\nAlthough there are pockets of weakness and potential sources of vulnerability, the overall rate of\nglobal growth has accelerated significantly and looks as if it's now running at the strongest levels in\nfour years.\nThe broad measures of U.S. consumer price inflation are very low. Inflation expectations as reflected\nin surveys and in the Treasury inflation-protected securities, although higher than current rates, still\nsuggest an outlook of very modest future price increases. Deflation risks worldwide appear to have\ndiminished, and there are some signs of accelerating price increases in some economies. Overall,\nhowever, despite the sharp increases in energy and commodity prices, the inflation outlook globally\nappears quite benign.\nAt the core of the U.S. economic experience of the past decade is a significant and sustained\nacceleration in productivity growth. This offers the prospect of more rapid growth in income over time,\nboth for the United States and for the rest of the world.\nIn the economics profession, there is a debate about whether we are in the midst of a secular trend\ncharacterized by lower GDP volatility and general price stability, which some have called the \"great\nmoderation.\" As important as the question of the extent of this moderation in macroeconomic volatility\nis the debate over its source. It's undoubtedly the result of a combination of factors, including better\neconomic policy, innovation and globalization, plus simple good fortune in the form of smaller shocks.\nBut, the relative contribution of these factors is uncertain.\nDespite the uncertainty that exists about the sources and durability of this apparent moderation in\nsome types of risks, financial market prices now reflect a very benign view of economic and credit\nfundamentals. Credit spreads generally and risk premia in many asset classes are at levels that are\nvery low even in relation to previous periods of relative optimism.\nThe U.S. financial system, when judged by many conventional measures, looks reasonably healthy as\nwell. Bank profitability is at the highest levels we have seen, depending on which measure you\nchoose, in two to three decades. Capital positions for U.S. banks, which have been around 13 percent\nof assets over the past two years, are very strong, significantly above the regulatory standards\nrequired to be considered well capitalized. Asset quality also remains robust. Nonperforming loan\nratios are now only 1.2 percent across the commercial banking industry. The financial markets are\npricing financial institution risk at very favorable levels, with bank equity prices, subordinated debt\nspreads, and credit default swap spreads suggesting a high degree of investor and counterparty\nconfidence in the financial health of the major banks and other financial institutions.\nAs these numbers suggest, the U.S. financial system came through the recent recession, the spate of\ncorporate bankruptcies, the sharp adjustment in some asset prices, and the difficulties in some\nemerging market economies in reasonably strong financial shape. This apparent resilience, relative to\npast downturns and relative to the experience of other countries, is the result of a number of factors.\nSome of these factors stem from developments outside the financial system, like better\nmacroeconomic policy and better microeconomic or supply-side fundamentals. And some stem from\nchanges in the nature of financial intermediation, the structure of the financial system, and the capacity\nof financial institutions to manage risk.\nTo start with the broader economic context, the strength and length of the expansion of the 1990s\nhelped ensure that U.S. financial institutions entered the latest recession with strong capital positions.\nThe fact that the recession was shallower and shorter than the average of the past helped limit the\nscale and scope of losses to financial institutions. The forcefulness of the monetary policy response\nand the large fiscal stimulus provided by the tax cuts and expenditure increases played a significant\nrole in limiting the depth of the downturn and in helping to bring about the recovery. It is significant that\nthe yield curve has been steeper and stayed steep longer in this latest recession than in the previous\none. And, finally, the stronger microeconomic fundamentals of the U.S. economy - the shift to\njust-in-time inventory management, the speed of innovation in the U.S. economy, and other factors\nthat seem to have reduced the amplitude of the business cycle and improved the flexibility and\nresilience of the U.S. economy in response to shocks - have also contributed to financial stability.\nChanges in the nature of financial intermediation have also played a role in improving the overall\nresilience and performance of the U.S. financial system that was evident in this latest period of\neconomic recession and financial stress. Four different types of changes are particularly important.\n•\nInnovation in financial technology continues to expand the opportunities for financial\ninstitutions to separate and distribute, and to manage and hedge, different types of risk.\n• The increasingly greater role played by the capital markets in the financial intermediation\nprocess relative to banks - both relative to the past and compared with most other major\neconomies - has improved the capacity of our system to handle stress. Loans and securities\nheld by commercial banks today account for less than 20 percent of overall U.S. credit\nmarket debt, roughly two--thirds of their 1975 levels.\n•\nThe increases in the sophistication of risk management techniques and enhancements to\nrisk management processes have delivered substantial improvements in how banks and\nother financial institutions actually manage risk in practice. Banks, for example, have aligned\ntheir pricing of credit products much more closely with credit risk.\n• The increased scale of cross-border financial intermediation, the growing role of securitized\nfinancial instruments in those overall flows, and the growth in the size and breadth of\nfinancial institutions with global operations may also mean that, as shocks are transmitted\nmore rapidly, they are diffused more broadly.\nThese are positive developments, and they are likely to be enduring. But they have come with new\nchallenges for those of you who manage financial institutions and for those of us charged with\nsupervision and market oversight. The overall return on these changes will depend on the skill with\nwhich we manage the challenges that come with them. Among these challenges are those that relate\nto the complexity of financial and operational risk management, concentration in critical markets,\ninternal governance to manage conflicts, the quality of public disclosure, opportunities for regulatory\nand capital arbitrage, and trend amplifying market dynamics in times of stress.\nThe financial innovations that have made risk transfer and hedging possible have increased the\ncomplexity of risk management, both financial and operational. The seemingly simple structure of a\nloan or bond issue can now involve a complex series of additional transactions that seek to allocate\nrisks and responsibilities along specialized lines. This increased number of transactions that need to\nbe separately settled and tracked by themselves create new risks that must be managed.\nThe economies of scale inherent in certain activities have led to a significant degree of concentration\nin some markets. A relatively small number of dealers account for a very large share of the\nover-the-counter derivatives business, with higher degrees of concentration in specific markets such\nas interest-rate options. Two institutions dominate the government securities clearing business. The\ngrowth in the size of government-sponsored mortgage entities creates a high degree of concentration\nin a market with very large systemic implications. Concentration has benefits, but it necessarily\nincreases the vulnerability of the system to an operational or financial disruption in a single institution,\nor the decision by a single institution to exit a particular business. Moreover, to the extent that the\nsame set of firms play dominant roles in multiple markets, this concentration can also give rise to\nlinkages between markets that are not apparent in normal circumstances and that could potentially\naffect how the financial system functions in conditions of acute stress.\nIncreased opportunities for diversification offer the prospect - though not the assurance - of lower\noverall volatility in earnings, but they also bring much more complicated management challenges in\ncontrolling conflicts, reputational risks, and operational risks. The actual gains achieved from\ndiversification depend on the correlation of movements in different sources of earnings and in\neconomic growth among different regions as well as the relative volatility of the new business lines into\nwhich the institution is diversifying. To the extent that diversification achieves lower overall volatility in\nearnings for the major financial institutions, it is clearly good for the stability of the system. But to fully\nexploit these potential gains requires careful attention to the design of the control and compliance\ninfrastructure, to monitoring and managing credit risk and concentration across diverse types of\nfinancial activities, and to managing conflicts of interest.\nThese are formidable challenges even for the strongest management teams. Trust and reputation are\nvaluable competitive assets for financial institutions, and the desire to preserve those assets creates a\npowerful incentive for firms to manage conflicts and compliance with exceptional care. Supervision\nand regulation, and the enforcement response to management failures, should help strengthen the\nincentives for a stronger compliance infrastructure, but they cannot insulate firms from the\nconsequences of reputational damage.\nFinancial innovation has made it possible for the market to assign values to a broader range of\nfinancial activities. And this, combined with improved disclosure, has increased the potential power of\nmarket discipline. But the increased complexity that comes with innovation also creates challenges for\ninvestor and counterparty risk assessment. Although the overall quality of disclosure has improved in\nrecent years, along with accounting and auditing processes that underpin the integrity of disclosure,\nthe complexity of public financial reporting can make it very difficult to discern the true picture of a\nfirm's financial condition and its exposure to risk.\nFinancial innovation has also made it possible for risk to migrate to - and for leverage to accumulate\nin - parts of the financial system with less strong, or simply different, supervision, capital requirements,\nor disclosure norms. Risk today, on balance, seems to be allocated more effectively to those\ninstitutions better able to manage and hold it, resulting in reduced risk to banks and to the financial\nsystem as a whole. However, limitations in the extent of public disclosure over institutions that hold\nlarge amounts of risk make it hard to develop a comprehensive picture. It is obviously in the interest of\ninstitutions that transfer credit risk, interest rate risk, or other risks to understand the performance\ncapabilities of those institutions from which they are purchasing protection. The ability to arrive at\ninformed independent judgments about counterparty risk, however, can be hindered by the gaps that\nremain in the quality of disclosure.\nThe same developments in financial technology that have improved the sophistication of risk\nmanagement and the ability to transfer risk can create positive feedback mechanisms that, for at least\nshort periods of time, amplify large moves in asset prices. There have been substantial increases over\nthe past decade in the capacity of the market, meaning the principal dealers, to handle very large\nincreases in hedging-related flows. This dimension of the financial infrastructure is critical to the\ncapacity of our markets to absorb and respond to large shocks. Dynamic hedging of options and other\nsimilar strategies, however, depend on the availability of sufficient liquidity to work effectively. Stressful\nperiods, of course, are marked precisely by a material reduction in market liquidity.\nThese changes in the nature of finance have several important implications for the supervisors and\nthose responsible for market oversight. Financial innovation will, in some ways, always move ahead of\nthe evolution in risk management techniques. As supervisors, our challenge is to work to ensure that\nthe sophistication of the supervisory process evolves to keep abreast of the pace of change in\nfinancial innovation. This is a formidable challenge, and we need to continue to work hard at it. The\nrevisions to the Basel Capital Accord, which aim to align supervisory assessments of capital adequacy\nmore closely with the frontier of risk management techniques, are a good example of these efforts.\nThe changes in the structure of finance and the nature of the financial intermediation process reinforce\nthe importance of cooperation between supervisory authorities. The sources of potential risk to\nfinancial stability are not confined to banks. Financial institutions increasingly operate across the legal\nparameters that define the responsibilities of the individual supervisory authorities. The economic\ncharacteristics of many of the financial credit instruments provided by banks and other financial\ninstitutions have converged. Our supervisory system is a complex framework in terms of the number of\nresponsible supervisory institutions, differences in approaches, overlaps, and gaps. This complexity\nmakes it even more important that we collectively work to ensure a comprehensive look at sources of\nsystemic risk and that we raise the bar on the quality of supervision and market oversight where it is\nnecessary.\nBank supervisors have made significant progress in improving how we share and divide\nresponsibilities for supervision of banks and bank holding companies, reduce overlap, and raise the\noverall contribution of the examination process. With the passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in\n1999, and the increased scope of activities it has allowed financial institutions to engage in across the\nfinancial services industry, we have worked to strengthen cooperation with other regulatory bodies.\nThis will be increasingly important to the effectiveness of the overall supervisory process, as the SEC\nmoves toward providing a form of consolidated supervision for the largest securities firms.\nAt the international level, we have made considerable progress in developing a network for\ncooperation and information sharing among national authorities that better matches the increased\nintegration of national financial systems. We have worked to clarify the division of labor among\nsupervisors of institutions with supra-national reach, and to cover gaps in the supervisory overlay. We\nhave also worked to identify and promote the adoption of best practices and standards for many\ndimensions of the institutional framework that underpins well-functioning financial markets.\nStrengthening home-host supervisory cooperation and avoiding duplication of supervisory efforts will\ncontinue to be top priorities for the international supervisory community, especially as we adopt newer\nsupervisory approaches, such as Basel II.\nFinally, we need to continue to promote investments in strengthening resilience in critical infrastructure\nin payments and settlement systems and those institutions that play an important role in market\nclearance systems. This is a critical part of the supervisory and market oversight process we perform,\nand there is an active public-private effort underway to bring about further improvements in back-up\nfacilities and overall resilience.\nThe innovations that have transformed finance over the past decade have substantially improved the\noverall stability and resilience of the U.S. financial system. But these improvements are unlikely to\nhave brought an end to what Charles Kindleberger called \"manias and panics\" in financial markets.\nThey cannot fully insulate the financial system from the effects of large macroeconomic shocks. And\nthey will not by themselves preclude the possibility of failure in a major financial institution or a critical\npiece of market infrastructure. For these reasons, it is important that those of you who run financial\ninstitutions build in a sufficient cushion against adversity.\nOf course, the overall performance of the financial system and the degree of financial stability depends\non more than just the skill of risk managers and supervisors. The unique strengths of the U.S. financial\nsystem in allocating capital to where long run returns are highest depend on the overall confidence\ninvestors have in the fairness and integrity of our financial markets. These strengths depend on our\nopenness to competition and the opportunities and rewards to innovation that the regulatory\nenvironment provides.\nThe stability of the financial system also depends significantly on the quality of macroeconomic policy,\nnot only in terms of the credibility of monetary policy, but also in the degree of confidence investors\nhave in U.S. fiscal management. The current deterioration in the U.S. fiscal position and the acute\ndecline in the net national savings rate represent risks to the financial system and the economy as a\nwhole. These risks are magnified by the size of the U.S. external imbalance and the unprecedented\nscale of financing requirements it reflects.\nAlthough the present economic environment looks quite favorable, these broader macroeconomic\npolicy challenges make it even more important that we build on the substantial progress we have\nalready made in strengthening risk management and the resilience of critical market infrastructure.\nOur success in meeting these challenges will help ensure that our financial system proves as resilient\nin the future as it has in the recent past.\nThank you.",

         "Donald L Kohn: Research at the Federal Reserve Board - the contributions of\nHenderson, Porter, and Tinsley\nRemarks by Mr Donald L Kohn, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Federal Reserve Board Models and Monetary Policy Conference, Washington, DC,\n26 March 2004.\n* * *\nI try not to reflect too much on my growing role as the one left behind who speaks at retirements and\noccasions such as this; but I am pleased, nonetheless, to participate in this conference and to have\nthe opportunity to pay tribute to these three leaders of research at the Federal Reserve. I have known\nDale, Dick, and Peter a long time in my various roles here as staff economist, Division director, and\nBoard member.\nActually, I met Dale first, when I was still at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, visiting\nWashington to interview for a job in the Research and Statistics Division at the Board. At that time\nDale spent a whole afternoon trying to help me figure out the analytics of an article I was writing for the\nKansas City economic review. A frustrating experience I am sure for Dale, and a frustration that Peter\nand Dick were soon to encounter, but one that improved the piece immeasurably. I had decided to\ncome here in any case if I got a job offer, but my experience with Dale just reinforced my desire and\nmy excitement at the opportunity to work with people of his caliber and his willingness to understand\nand help his colleagues and would-be colleagues.\nI began to work with Dick and Peter sometime after I arrived here. It took a while, inasmuch as they\nwere over at the Watergate in temporary quarters while the Martin building was under construction. I\nsuspected that folks over there were having more fun than those of us slaving away in the Eccles\nBuilding under adult supervision - a suspicion later confirmed when I found out that the \"One Step\nDown\" so often mentioned by Watergate economists did not refer to the entrance to the computer\ncenter, but rather to a certain watering hole on Pennsylvania Avenue. The Watergate seemed\nsomewhat alien and forbidding territory to a current analyst. But as I became more involved in the\nresearch work and as they migrated back to the Martin Building, I found Dick and Peter and the other\nresearchers just as stimulating and congenial colleagues as I had anticipated.\nI want to highlight and celebrate their careers here, but I want to do so in the context of our overall\nresearch effort and its critical role at the Board. Their accomplishments illustrate nicely what is best\nabout what we do here, though I am sure they would agree that their leadership of the overall research\neffort and the path they set it on represent a more important contribution than their individual output.\nResearch at the Board - the historical context\nThe importance of economic research was recognized very early at the Federal Reserve. The Board\nencouraged and supported research activities virtually from the founding of the System. Throughout its\nhistory, it also provided an inviting and collegial environment for research economists, including many\nwho continued their research at other policy institutions or universities and some of whom also came\nback to the Federal Reserve in leadership positions over the years.\nBy the 1920s, Board economists had already made a number of important research contributions. In\npart, these early research efforts were driven by necessity. When the Federal Reserve started its\noperations in 1914, aggregate data for the United States were virtually non-existent. Early research\nefforts at the Federal Reserve included the pathbreaking compilation of statistical indexes that\npermitted policymakers, for the first time in the nation's history, to monitor macroeconomic\ndevelopments with some degree of accuracy. Besides measures of credit and indexes of industrial\nproduction that the Federal Reserve still produces today, during those early years the Board staff\ndeveloped and published various other indexes for such critical concepts as aggregate sales,\nemployment, payrolls, and prices. Coupled with advances in estimating seasonal factors and secular\ntrends, these early efforts vastly improved economists' understanding of the interrelationships of\nprices, production, employment, and credit and facilitated a more systematic study of the business\ncycle and the role of monetary policy.\nAnother important advance was the recognition of the powerful role of open market operations in the\npolicy process. Open market operations were not new when the Federal Reserve was created. But in\nthe 1920s, the Federal Reserve first showed how they could be employed for effective monetary\ncontrol, and this demonstration proved an invaluable contribution to the development of modern\ncentral banking.\nFurther, Federal Reserve economists and policymakers developed criteria and guidelines for monetary\npolicy aimed at achieving and maintaining economic stability. The policy framework outlined in the\nBoard's tenth annual report (for 1923) is widely praised by monetary historians. Indeed, by 1923, when\nthe Board organized the Division of Research and Statistics (the precursor of all three modern\nresearch divisions at the Federal Reserve), research economists at the young institution were at the\nforefront of policy-relevant economic research and the Federal Reserve had probably become the first\ncentral banking institution at which economic policy research provided a solid analytical basis for\npolicy discussions and decisions.\nTo be sure, economic knowledge does not evolve in a straight path and setbacks are inevitable and\nunfortunate - the monetary policy failures of the 1930s and those of the 1970s are powerful reminders\nof that. But the research tradition that had started in the early days of the System is still with us, and\ntoday arguably plays a more central role in the policy process than ever before.\nCharacteristics of research at the Board\nFor the most part, research at the Board has for many years been closely intertwined with policy and\nwith current analysis and forecasting. In many other countries, it is not. At many central banks,\nresearch and current analysis are carried out in separate divisions, and interaction between the two\ngroups of economists is limited.\nAt the Board, the mixing of research and operational work was not quite as thorough as it is today. In\nthe 1970s and 1980s, many researchers, such as our three honorees, were doing work directly\napplicable to policy. But others had few day-to-day responsibilities and were fairly free to concentrate\non long-run research projects, some of which appeared to have only tenuous connection to the work\nof the Board. Such a division of the staff was not popular with everyone, and tensions did arise. Partly\nfor this reason, the distinction between operational and research sections was largely eliminated by\nthe early 1990s.\nThis move not only improved morale, it also led to a cross-fertilization of ideas that improved the\nquality of both research and policy analysis. Researchers actively engaging in policy analysis and\nparticipating in Federal Open Market Committee preparations better understand the issues facing\npolicymakers and can target their efforts. On occasion - rare, I suspect - research economists actually\nbenefit from the ideas of the policymakers. They also come to appreciate that policymakers need to\nhear sensible stories in clear English about the concepts being presented so that the policymakers in\nturn can explain understandably to the public why they are following a particular strategy. Getting\nsome researchers to write in English has proved daunting, and too often, the policymakers themselves\nhave not lived up to their side of the bargain.\nThe engagement of researchers in the policy process has served to remind them that social welfare is\nnot necessarily enhanced by pursuing only academically fashionable topics. In fact, Board staff, like\nmonks in the Middle Ages, kept policy research alive through the dark night that initially settled on\nacademic analysis of monetary policy following the Lucas critique and real-business-cycle theory.\nFrom the policymaker's perspective, researchers have improved the decisionmaking process by\nkeeping in view the overall economy, with all its interactions. They remind us that if you push on the\nsystem in one place - altering an assumption or an implicit equation - it will have consequences\nad hoc\nelsewhere. Those little adjustments policymakers find so convenient are not a free good.\nResearchers set high standards for analytical rigor. Policy must have a sound intellectual base.\nPolicymakers should be able to write down their models, even if in only a sketchy literary form. If those\nmodels cannot be articulated, they are probably flawed. And researchers can improve the policy\nprocess by thinking creatively and bringing new ideas and approaches to the table - ideas they have\ngenerated themselves or have harvested from recent academic work that may not be easily accessible\nto the policymakers.\nContributions of Henderson, Porter, and Tinsley to Board research\nHenderson, Porter, and Tinsley have contributed to policymaking in all those ways. I have chosen to\noutline their contributions by grouping them into the broad subject areas that have occupied much\nBoard research.\nLarge-scale macromodels\nIn many important respects, large-scale modeling of the U.S. and world economies has been at the\ncrossroads of policy and research at the Federal Reserve since the 1960s. Those models are used in\nforecasting and policy analysis; their results show up in every Greenbook, many Bluebooks, and in\nbriefings to the Board and the FOMC. Dale, Dick, and Peter have all been deeply involved and very\ninfluential in these efforts.\nPeter's contributions to large-scale modeling in R&S have been immense. They came in two waves,\nbut with remarkable intellectual consistency and foresight. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he wrote\na number of papers related to the design of structural models, in early efforts to combine\nforward-looking behavior with significant costs of adjustment. Of course, more recently, in the 1990s,\nhe returned to these themes and worked them out in guiding the construction of FRB/US. Perhaps\neven more important, Peter pioneered the use of these models in policy analysis with his work on\noptimal control in the 1970s. It did not find a very receptive audience back then, but it has returned\nmore recently in policy simulations to a slightly warmer welcome - owing in part to the influence of the\nbetter modeling mousetrap Peter and his colleagues constructed.\nA few years after he arrived here as a visiting professor, Dick became head of the section in R&S that\nhoused the MPS model. As head of the section from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s he fought for the\nresources necessary to continue developing the model and expanding its policy use, an important\nundertaking under any circumstances but particularly so during that tumultuous period for\npolicy-relevant modeling work. Dick also played a crucial role in advancing a set of internal projects to\nproduce operational procedures for the estimation and simulation of large-scale rational expectations\nmodels - tools that facilitated later model development work at the Board and elsewhere.\nAlthough Dale never directly oversaw the large modeling efforts in the International Finance Division,\nhe has played a key role in the Division's efforts through the years. Dale made several contributions to\nthe basic economics of the Multi-Country Model, and one of his models was used to set forth the\nMCM's properties. Dale was a major advocate of the model development efforts that led to FRB\nGlobal. He also played a large role in the two Brookings model projects that greatly advanced the\nlarge modeling field.\nOther model-based analysis\nThe building and simulation of large models is not the only way researchers can contribute to policy\ndesign. Policymakers are looking for insights that are not so dependent on the particular model\nconstruct. All three of our honorees have been involved in an enormous volume of research in this\narea.\nDale did path-breaking work on the international policy coordination problems that arose with the\nbreakdown of the Bretton Woods system. Along with other Brookings Project participants, Dale carried\nout much of the original research into simple interest rate policy rules, with important and influential\ninsights on the characteristics that might be helpful in jointly stabilizing activity and prices. He is now\ninvolved in the investigation of optimal strategies in the context of DGE models. And I certainly would\nnot want to neglect his recent insightful work that places inflation targeting under a skeptical\nmicroscope.\nA good deal of Dick's output in this area has involved the monetary aggregates. He has worked on\nvirtually every aspect of the aggregates: the demand for money; their definition and measurement;\ntheir control; and their use in policy design - including the P-star model that developed an idea by a\ncertain A. Greenspan. It is easy to forget how central the aggregates were to policymaking at a time\nwhen structural change and rapid changes in inflation expectations reduced the usefulness of\nlarge-scale models. Dick's work was integral to providing and explaining the framework that broke the\nback of inflation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and it has been widely used by other central banks.\nWhile the discipline provided by stricter monetary aggregate guides became much less crucial once\ninflation was brought under control, Dick's work has continued to provide us with useful reminders of\nthe value of monitoring money. Moreover, the only reason that we have some confidence that one-half\nto two-thirds of U.S. currency is held abroad is because Dick's inquisitive mind wondered along such\npaths as differential seasonality across countries and fish migration.\nPeter also was deeply involved in the monetary aggregates research in the 1970s - so much so that\nhe was willing to go mano-a-mano with Steve Axilrod on the definition of M1 at the Board table -\nlosing, of course, but winning the hearts, if not the minds, of his colleagues for his valor. Later in his\ncareer, Peter came up with innovative approaches to policy at the zero bound for interest rates, a\npotentially critical issue in a period of very low inflation.\nAsset prices\nAsset markets are of particular interest to policymakers as the transmission channel through which\nmovements in money or short-term interest rates primarily affect the economy. Because their prices\nincorporate market expectations for the future, they are also an area in which policy indicators might\nbe found.\nThe huge literature on speculative attacks in exchange markets started with Dale's work with Steve\nSalant on gold. It significantly influenced the thinking of an intern at the Board, one P. Krugman, who,\nin his pre-political mode, extended the thinking to foreign exchange crises. Dale's understanding of\nexchange markets intersected with his understanding of macroeconomics and policy in a number of\nstudies that have tried to inject sense and analysis into discussions of sterilized interventions.\nDick's work on asset markets includes his seminal work with Steve LeRoy on variance bounds tests\non present-value relations. Their demonstration that equity prices were excessively volatile relative to\nwhat would be consistent with the efficient capital markets model posed a fundamental challenge to\nthe theory of finance and spearheaded a vast literature aimed at improving our understanding of asset\npricing and market efficiency.\nDuring the 1980s, Peter also contributed to understanding in this area through his work on commodity\nprice determination and the indicator properties of such prices for monetary policy. More recently,\nPeter - working jointly with Sharon Kozicki - has been busy advancing our understanding of bond\nmarket dynamics. In a sequence of papers, they have demonstrated the important role played in these\ndynamics by changes in the market's perception of long-run \"end-points,\" such as the implicit target for\ninflation and the economy's equilibrium real interest rate.\nEmpirical methodology\nBecause we are a policy institution held accountable for actual outcomes, research at the Board has\nalways involved empirical testing. And in this area, Board researchers have often been found pushing\nout the production-possibility frontier for the profession more generally. Our heroes have battled in this\narea as well, both through their insistence on the best possible empirical work and their own\ncontributions to methods of computation and testing.\nEarly in his career, Dick contributed to the literature on filtering and seasonal time series analysis -\ntopics of perennial interest at the Federal Reserve. He also worked on the use of survey sample\nweights in the linear model, on estimating linear models with partial prior information, and on other\ntopics, always motivated by pressing empirical questions and ready to explore and adopt new\nmethods and techniques whenever they promised to improve the odds of a more reliable answer.\nBack in the mid-1970s, Peter was an early advocate of using advanced statistical techniques in policy\nanalysis - at a time when IBM mainframes were a long way from a Pentium 4. Working with P.A.V.B.\nSwamy and others, Peter carried out the herculean task of estimating random-coefficient models. He\nalso investigated the gains to forecast accuracy from pooling the predictions of multiple models, a path\nthat eventually led to the ambitious model-linkage project of the 1980s.\nUnsung contributions\nPolicy work need not always pay off in lots of published papers or even in success to have a favorable\ninfluence.\nDick's work on currency demand and the amount of U.S. currency held abroad has been published, of\ncourse, but its greatest public policy payoff has come behind the scenes, in helping the U.S.\ngovernment look more effectively for counterfeiters.\nPeter burned countless hours of staff and machine time chasing the holy grail of a monthly estimate of\nGDP. Monthly GDP remained an elusive quarry, but the techniques he pioneered in the process\nbecame an integral part of the tool kit used by sector analysts to translate high-frequency indicators\ninto predictions of near-term movements in quarterly GDP and its components.\nDale has slaved many hours helping refine the Division of International Finance positions on hardy\nperennials like the sustainability of the U.S. current account and the effectiveness of sterilized\nintervention.\nLeadership\nThe most important contributions these three made were as colleagues and leaders. They have\nreminded us every day in our interactions with them that ideas are important and that policy must have\na rigorous intellectual framework - one capable of being discussed and tested. They have insisted that\npolicy analysis incorporate the latest insights from economic theory and econometrics. They have\nfought the Philistines who saw research as a soft target in times of budget crunch; they made sure the\nBoard did not eat its intellectual seed corn.\nThey recognized that one role of research at the Board has been to challenge the policymakers, to be\nan irritant - sometimes with considerable success - to think outside the tidy intellectual boxes too often\nfound in the minds of Division directors and Board members.\nMy early encounter with Dale on my Kansas City Fed article was indeed characteristic. Each has\nalways been willing to lend a hand working through a tough problem and helping explain to a slower\ncolleague - over-and-over again, in my case. They have been active recruiters and mentors to\ngenerations of economists, leading as much by example as by the particular position they happened\nto occupy in the staff bureaucracy.\nThey have been worthy inheritors of the proud tradition and have made it even better. Dale, Dick,\nPeter, on behalf of all your colleagues past, present, and future, thank you.",

         "Edward M Gramlich: The Board's modeling work in the 1960s\nRemarks by Mr Edward M Gramlich, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Federal Reserve Board Models and Monetary Policy Conference, Washington, DC,\n26 March 2004.\n* * *\nI am delighted to be speaking at a conference honoring Dale Henderson, Dick Porter, and Peter\nTinsley. I remember all of them from long ago. Peter and I joined the Board staff in September 1965,\nwhen Pat Hendershott and Bob Parry also joined. At least in terms of longevity, that was a pretty\nsignificant hiring month. I remember being on a panel with Dick at an academic conference in those\ndays. He had not yet joined the Board, being an assistant professor at Ohio State. Being thoroughly a\nMichigan man now, I probably should not admit it, but I also met him, along with Dave Lindsey, when I\ninterviewed for a job at Ohio State. The job interview didn't pan out, I think mainly on my side but\nperhaps on theirs too.\nI also knew Dale back then. He joined the Board shortly after I left, but I met him socially in the early\n1970s. Frankly, I still remember one thing he said to me. When I mentioned that I used to be on the\nBoard's staff, he said he knew - he had read some of my stuff. \"Well,\" I said expectantly. \"Oh, some of\nit's OK,\" he said. With his subsequent international exposure, Dale has gotten much more diplomatic\nover the years.\nAll three principals have made great contributions to economic modeling at the Board. Peter started\nwith optimal control techniques and distributed lags, and continued with rational expectations\nestimation procedures. Dick's work focused on money demand and monetary control techniques. Dale\nwas instrumental in developing the Board's global model. All three have generally promoted research\nat the Board, helped younger scholars get established, sponsored working paper series, and fought\nfor better computers and other support.\nAs for the models themselves, the topic of the conference, I feel like Rip Van Winkle. In the very early\ndays, 1965-70, I was here and indeed right in the middle of the producer side of the model work. Then\nI went off and did other things for twenty-seven years, returning in 1997 as a consumer of models.\nThings changed a lot in those twenty-seven years.\nMost of you are reasonably familiar with what the model looks like now. But apart from the real\ngraybeards, the three principals and I, most of you were probably in grade school when this work\nactually started. Let me recall a few stories from the old days.\nThe main motivator at the Board in those days was Frank de Leeuw. For all who knew Frank, he was\none of the most \"market undervalued\" economists of all time. All the young people at the Fed then felt\nhe walked on water. Frank formed a team of economists here - Tinsley, Hendershott, Al Tella, and me\namong others - and an academic team featuring the late Franco Modigliani from MIT and the late\nAlbert Ando from Penn. Bob Rasche, now research director at the St. Louis Fed, and Harold Shapiro,\nlater to be my university president at Michigan, were also junior professors at Penn and part of the\nteam. Jerry Enzler, whom many of you remember fondly, as I do, was somewhere in transition,\nstarting as a Penn graduate student and moving to the Board staff, where he too stayed many years.\nThe model we put together in those days has been enshrined in publications and I won't describe it\nmuch. It probably had about the coverage of the present day FRBUS, and it had many of the then\nexotic channels of monetary policy. There was a consumption-wealth effect working through equity\nvalues and housing values, and both of those prices were endogenous. At one point, Franco got one\nof his graduate students, a lively kid named Larry Meyer, to do his thesis on this link. There was a\nforeign sector, but exchange rates were exogenous because we had pegged rates back then. There\nwas also a credit-rationing channel based largely on the work of another Franco graduate student,\nDwight Jaffee, who is now an authority on government-sponsored enterprises at Berkeley.\nWhat we didn't have in those days was forward-looking expectations behavior. In qualitative terms we\nall knew the difference between adaptive and rational expectations, but nobody knew how to estimate\nrational expectations equations. This is one area where technical work over the years has made a\nlarge difference, and I gather that several people in the room, especially Peter Tinsley, have been\nresponsible. In more immediate terms, the aspect of the model that still recalls frustration was that\nwhenever we ran dynamic full-model simulations, the simulations would blow up. I can't tell you how\nmany hours Jerry Enzler and I spent feeding in our regression cards, and our simulation cards, to work\non this issue. Yes, we fed in punch cards in those days. Nowadays when Board economists present\nthe results of dynamic simulations in briefings, and the simulations look very reasonable, I think I am\none of the few people in the room who is deeply impressed.\nDoctrinal historians will have fun with the naming of this model. Whenever Board people wrote about\nit, it was the Fed-MIT model, or perhaps the Fed-MIT-Penn model. When Ando wrote it became the\nMPS model - MIT-Penn-Social Science Research Council model. All the Social Science Research\nCouncil did was to give Ando a grant. And where was the Fed? We did do a lot of the early work on\nthe model.\nA number of people have raised questions about monetary and fiscal policy itself in the 1960s - how\ncould policy have been so misguided? First off, let me say that the modeling group was quite aware of\nthe natural rate hypothesis then. We knew that an adaptive expectations Phillips Curve would explode\nif the lag coefficient was one - we just couldn't get its estimated value to be one. We had yet to apply\nKalman filters or other split-sample techniques and were yet to realize the problems with the sum of\nthe lagged coefficients test. But even apart from lag effects, as papers by Bill Poole (another Division\nof Research and Statistics staff member from those days), George de Menil (another Franco student),\nand Jerry Enzler show, our nonlinear Phillips Curves became very, very steep at low unemployment\nrates, implying that inflation would become uncontrollable at low unemployment rates.\nOn the point Athanasios Orphanides raises about the value of the natural rate, we probably were\nwrong about that. I remember being stunned by a Bob Hall paper in the 1970s that placed the natural\nrate at about 5 percent. By the way, in the mid-1970s Franco began calling this rate NIRU, and later\nJim Tobin, I think, switched it over to NAIRU.\nBut the main problems with policy in those days were, um, with the policymakers. First off, presidential\ninterference on discount rate policy got the discount rate set below the funds rate in 1965, a problem\nwe never fixed until two years ago. I think this artificially low discount rate may have held down the\nfunds rate, leading to the overly expansionary monetary policy amply documented by John Taylor. It\nwas obvious to virtually all economists that the country needed a permanent budget shift as Vietnam\nspending increased, but what came out of that was a delayed temporary tax increase. Anything else\nwould have made the war less popular, and by then the Vietnam War was pretty darn unpopular. Quite\npossibly, our intellectual understanding was not where it should have been in the late 1960s, but\n90 percent of the policy problems were political, with the policymakers themselves.\nThese days the Board staff makes a baseline forecast and grafts on FRBUS to get the results for\nalternative scenarios. We actually began to do these types of experiments once our model was put\ntogether in the late 1960s. I was dying to present the results to the Board, but never could get past\nLyle Gramley, our sponsor but also our gatekeeper. He didn't trust the model enough when it was\nused as a pure forecasting device. Then, as I suppose now, we had the most trouble forecasting\nequipment investment - most of the other final demand sectors worked pretty well. The investment\naccelerator was also the reason our dynamic simulations ran off-track. When we would suspend the\ninvestment equation, things would work reasonably well. I have heard the modern day staff complain\nabout estimating an accelerator effect for equipment and software and, believe me, I am sympathetic.\nAnother place where the intervening years have made a real difference is the way in which the\nbaseline forecast itself was put together. In our day it was totally anticipations data - leading indicators\nof this or that, for a quarter or two ahead at most. Today I hear Dave Stockton describe the baseline\nforecast in very model-oriented terms - this effect, that coefficient, and so forth. Nowadays the\nbaseline forecast also runs out a few years, something the judgmental forecasters of earlier days\nwould never have attempted, and it even has measures of forecast uncertainty. All of these are real\nimprovements, far beyond what was done in the 1960s.\nFor me, this work all came to an end in May 1970. At the time I felt we had brought the model as far as\nI thought we could bring it, at least for a while, and I really wanted to do some other kind of economics.\nWhether the external pastures were in fact greener I will never know - they just seemed greener at the\ntime. So I left the Board staff, confident that I would never return either to the Board or to large-scale\nmacro modeling. But sure enough, there were some other twists of fate and here I am, back, as a\nmodel consumer. And, I think, an ideal consumer because I realize how hard it is to do this kind of\nwork.",

         "Ben S Bernanke: Monetary policy modeling - where are we and where should\nwe be going?\nRemarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Federal Reserve Board Models and Monetary Policy Conference, Washington, DC,\n27 March 2004.\nThe references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.\n* * *\nOur honorees, Dale Henderson, Richard Porter, and Peter Tinsley, have already received much\nwelldeserved praise. I will add only one brief observation. Although I am a relative newcomer to the\nFederal Reserve, I have already had numerous occasions to be impressed by the research staff here.\nThe Board staff has what a management expert might call a terrific corporate culture. They understand\nthat they make crucial contributions to the policymaking process, not only in the realm of monetary\npolicy but in banking, payments, consumer affairs, and other areas, and they bring great pride and\nprofessionalism to their work. Moreover, they understand the value of sophisticated and subtle\neconomic analysis, which they apply both to day-to-day questions of policy and to more fundamental\nresearch questions. A culture like that doesn't just happen; it requires senior people who lead by\nexample. In their times at the Board, Dale Henderson, Dick Porter, and Peter Tinsley, each in his own\nway, have promoted a culture that combines the best in policy-oriented research with the intellectual\nrigor and curiosity needed to address questions that go beyond the immediate economic situation.\nThat is an outstanding contribution, one that should be recognized in addition to the many intellectual\ncontributions that each of these scholars has made to the economic literature.\nThe theme of the panel is \"Monetary Policy Modeling: Where Are We and Where Should Be Going?\"\nForecasting the direction of successful research is inherently very difficult. There is a kind of efficient\nmarkets principle at work; if a promising direction for research were obvious, someone would have\nalready pursued it. So I think the best I can do is highlight three general areas in which much good\nwork has already been done, including research by Messrs. Henderson, Porter, and Tinsley, but in\nwhich further progress would be enormously helpful to monetary policymaking in practice.\nThe first area is the characterization of good monetary policy in increasingly realistic and complex\nmodel environments. Henderson, Porter, and Tinsley have all made significant contributions to\nmacroeconomic modeling at the Board. For specificity, I will focus on a piece of recent research that I\nlike very much and which has already received much attention at this conference: Dale Henderson's\npaper with Christopher Erceg and Andrew Levin (2003).\nWe have learned a great deal in recent years about the effects of monetary policy in dynamic,\nstochastic, sticky-price models, with Michael Woodford's recent book (Woodford, 2003) perhaps best\nrepresenting the state of the art. This line of research is potentially of great importance to applied\nmacro modelers, because it addresses areas in which some may feel that our current policy models\nneed to be strengthened, notably the treatment of expectations, the specification of model dynamics,\nand the relationship of the economic structure to the form of the policy rule. However, naturally\nenough, the earliest models in this genre have tended to be highly simplified representations of the\neconomy, only loosely matched to the data. Like the models themselves, the optimal policy rules\nderived in the models are often unrealistically simple. For example, in some of these models, strict\ninflation targeting - a policy of keeping inflation at zero at all times - is the optimal policy.\nTo make these models relevant for applied policy analysis, the natural next step is to add new frictions\nand more complex dynamics to the benchmark models. The Erceg-Henderson-Levin (EHL) paper\nexplores the implications for monetary policy of a plausible complication, the inclusion in the model of\nnominal wage stickiness as well as price stickiness. As was discussed yesterday, this relatively simple\naddition makes an important qualitative difference in the policy results. Specifically, in the EHL model,\nmonetary policy can no longer achieve a fully optimal outcome but instead faces tradeoffs among its\nobjectives. Because the optimal rule in their model is relatively complex and depends on model\nparameters and shocks, EHL use model simulations to examine the performance of some simple\npolicy rules. Interestingly, they find that relatively simple policy strategies can achieve results close to\nthe optimum.\nThe contribution of the EHL paper goes beyond the specific findings; equally important is the direction\nthat this work sets for the collective research program. Erceg, Henderson, and Levin have shown by\nexample that incorporating additional, realistic frictions into the basic new-Keynesian model changes\nboth the behavior of the model and the nature of the optimal policy rule in nontrivial ways. The papers\nat this conference by Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba (2004) and by Benigno and Woodford (2004) both\ntake up the EHL challenge. For example, Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba consider further complications\nof the sticky-price, sticky-wage model, including capital investment and habit formation in\nconsumption, while Benigno and Woodford explore the case in which the steady state of the model is\nnot Pareto optimal, as assumed by EHL. This progressive analysis of the implications of alternative\nassumptions is part of what Thomas Kuhn called \"normal science.\" The insights from these types of\nmodeling efforts are already informing policy analysis at the Board, and their influence will only grow\nas they become more detailed and realistic.\nA second important area, one that will always be central to monetary policy, is macro forecasting.\nBecause monetary policy works with a lag, the ability of policymakers to stabilize the economy\ndepends critically on our ability to peer into our cloudy crystal balls and see something resembling the\nfuture. One of the key variables to be forecast is inflation. A variety of approaches to forecasting\ninflation are used at the Board, of course. One of Dick Porter's many contributions was to develop a\nmonetary approach to forecasting inflation at medium-term horizons.\nDick's so-called P-star approach, originally developed with Jeffrey Hallman and David Small (1991)\nand updated in a 2000 paper with Athanasios Orphanides, combines simplicity with insight. Porter's\nanalysis begins with an equation so basic that, at one time at least, it appeared on the California\nlicense plate of Milton Friedman's personal automobile. That equation is of course the quantity\nequation, MV = PY, or money times velocity equals the price level times output. This equation can be\nused to define a link between money growth and inflation that depends on the evolution of the velocity\nof money. Hallman, Porter, and Small (1991) analyzed the predictive power of that relationship under\nthe assumption that M2 velocity is a constant - an assumption that seemed reasonable at the time\nthey wrote, but, as these things are wont to do, broke down soon after they did their initial work.\nOrphanides and Porter (2000) have developed a more sophisticated version of the P-star model,\nwhich employs information about the opportunity cost of holding M2 to track the evolution of\nequilibrium M2 velocity. This approach seems to work reasonably well at predicting inflation at\nmedium-term horizons, and the forecasts of this model are reported routinely to the Board of\nGovernors. Of course, something very similar to Porter's approach was used by the Bundesbank prior\nto the formation of the euro area and is used by the European Central Bank today.\nMy own view is that a reliable macroeconomic forecast requires looking at many different types of\neconomic data and considering a variety of forecasting models; any single model or approach is likely\nto go off the rails at one time or another. For this reason, I am personally attracted to factor models,\nwhich summarize large amounts of data (as in Bernanke and Boivin, 2003), and to model averaging,\nalong with more structured analyses. Interesting alternative models, like Porter's P-star model, are\nuseful because they give yet another perspective on the likely evolution of a critical macroeconomic\nvariable and thus provide a check on other forecasts that one might have in hand. Because good\nforecasts are so crucial to good monetary policy, I hope and expect to see a great deal more work\nexploring the robustness of alternative forecasting methods.\nThe third and final research area that I would like to highlight is the analysis of how the public forms its\nexpectations, and of the effects of various expectations formation mechanisms on macroeconomic\ndynamics. For example, a rich recent literature on learning and macroeconomics has emphasized that\nactual inflation and inflation expectations may to some degree evolve independently, and that effective\nmonetary policy stabilizes inflation expectations as well as inflation itself (Orphanides and Williams,\n2003). Peter Tinsley, in a series of papers with Sharon Kozicki, has explored this theme in great detail.\nFor example, Kozicki and Tinsley (2001) show that it is far easier to make sense of the term structure\nof Treasury yields if one assumes that expectations about long-run inflation adjust in a reasonable\nadaptive manner. In a paper presented at a recent conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco, Kozicki and Tinsley (2003) develop an empirical model of the economy under the\nassumptions that the Fed's implicit inflation target is subject to permanent shocks and that the public\nlearns about the Fed's target over time. Although simple, their model allows for a much richer and\nrealistic description of the evolution of monetary policy and the economy. For example, their approach\ngives empirical content to the idea of imperfect monetary policy credibility; in their model, monetary\npolicy is credible when private expectations of long-run inflation tend to align closely with the central\nbank's true underlying inflation target. Their model also illustrates clearly the benefits of central bank\ncredibility for macroeconomic stability. I think that further theoretical and empirical work on\nexpectations formation mechanisms and their links to economic dynamics will prove highly fruitful.\nI will conclude by thanking the organizers for their hard work in putting together this conference. A\nresearch conference of the quality of this one is exactly the right way to honor the scholarly\ncontributions of Dale, Dick, and Peter.",

         "Ben S Bernanke: Trade and jobs\nRemarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Distinguished Speaker Series, Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham,\n30 March 2004.\nThe references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.\n* * *\nEconomists are often accused of not being able to agree on anything. Although we are indeed a\ncontentious bunch, one proposition commands almost unanimous assent within the economics\ncommunity. That proposition is that free trade among nations promotes economic prosperity.\nThe economist's argument for free trade is disarmingly simple.1 Trade is beneficial because it\nfacilitates the division of labor, allowing each person to specialize in the type of production at which he\nor she is relatively most efficient. At the most basic level, a world in which each person produced\neverything that he or she consumed would be primitive indeed, as no single person or family in\nisolation could produce more than a few rudimentary goods and services. In contrast, if each person\nconcentrates on just a few activities, economies of scale and the development of specialized skills\nallow production to become much more efficient. Thus, if each of us focuses our efforts on just a few\ntypes of production and then trades our output with others, we can enjoy a far more varied and\nabundant supply of goods and services than we could if each person remained an isolated economic\nunit.2 Moreover, specialization tends to encourage innovation and hence promotes dynamism and\ngrowth as well as efficiency.\nWhat applies to individuals would seem to apply to nations as well. Two centuries ago the economist\nDavid Ricardo famously observed that, if England specializes in making cloth while Portugal\nspecializes in producing wine, international trade allows both countries to enjoy more of both goods\nthan would be possible if each country produced only for domestic consumption and did not trade. A\ntelling confirmation of Ricardo's insight is that, when nations go to war, the first order of business is\noften for each combatant to try to block the other's access to trade. The Union won the Civil War in\nlarge part because its blockade of Southern ports prevented the Confederacy from exporting its cotton,\nand the outcomes of both World War I and World War II turned on the fact that Great Britain and its\nallies were able to disrupt German trade more successfully than Germany's submarines could impede\nthe flow of goods into and out of Great Britain.\nDespite what seems to economists to be a compelling case for trade, non-economists are far more\nskeptical. A perennial public concern, from the emergence of the \"Rust Belt\" in the 1980s, to the days\nof Ross Perot's \"giant sucking sound,\" to the more recent debate about the effects of international\noutsourcing, is that the expansion of trade will cause production to move abroad, at the expense of\ndomestic employment. Such worries become particularly acute at times like the present, when the\nlabor market is weak and net job creation is depressed.\nFrom an economist's perspective, focusing on the impact of trade on jobs alone is unduly narrow, as\nmany of the benefits of trade accrue to consumers, in the form of greater access to goods and\nservices, rather than to producers. Nevertheless, employment is certainly an important issue,\nparticularly given recent experience. In my remarks today I will explore the much-debated connection\nbetween trade and jobs. I will begin by asking whether trade in general destroys jobs, then consider\nthe specific case of trade in business services, often referred to as outsourcing abroad or \"offshoring.\"\nBroadly, I will argue that, although trade in general, and outsourcing abroad in particular, may bring\nwith them structural change in the economy, they are not the principal reason for the current\nunderperformance of the labor market. Rather, the sources of slow job creation are primarily domestic.\nI will conclude by discussing the role of government policies in addressing both the current weakness\nof the U.S. labor market and the plight of displaced workers. I should note before beginning that the\nviews I express today are not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve.3\nDoes trade destroy jobs?\nDoes trade destroy jobs? Increases in trade or changes in trading patterns can indeed destroy some\nspecific jobs. People here in North Carolina are all too aware that increased foreign competition has\nbeen a factor in the loss of jobs recently experienced in textiles, furniture, and other industries. These\njob losses can loom large in specific industries and geographic areas, creating hardships for affected\nworkers, their families, and their communities. The appropriate social and political response to these\nundeniable job losses is a critical issue, one to which I will return.\nFor now, however, I will point out that although trade does lead to the loss of jobs in some industries\nand locations, trade also creates jobs, both directly and indirectly. Directly, trade creates jobs in the\nUnited States by expanding the potential market for U.S. goods and services. To take one leading\nexample, in 2003 the United States exported $47 billion in civilian aircraft, parts, and engines, while\nimporting only $24 billion, for a trade surplus of $23 billion in that category. More relevant to North\nCarolina, U.S. agriculture sends much of its product abroad. For example, in the 2002-03 crop year,\nthe United States exported 53 percent of its total wheat production, 69 percent of its output of cotton,\n50 percent of its sorghum, 59 percent of rice production, 38 percent of the soybean crop, and\n11 percent of its output of meat and poultry. Clearly, farmers benefit greatly from having access to\ninternational markets. Reflecting American creativity in the arts and in technology, in 2003 the United\nStates ran a surplus of $28 billion in royalty payments and licensing fees.\nTrade also creates jobs indirectly, in a variety of ways. First, trade allows firms to obtain inputs to\nproduction that are cheaper, of higher quality, or both, than would be possible if all inputs were\nproduced domestically. For example, imports of high-tech equipment have helped many U.S. firms,\nincluding large numbers of small businesses, to reduce costs and improve productivity, thereby\nenhancing their competitiveness in world markets. Obviously, firms that cannot compete in the world\nmarketplace will not be able to provide jobs at home.\nSecond, although imports may compete with domestic production, they also improve the lot of\nconsumers by giving them better variety in and better prices for the goods and services they buy.\nMoreover, the savings that consumers enjoy because of the availability of lower-cost imports\neffectively increase household purchasing power, extra income that can be spent on other goods and\nservices, including those produced domestically.\nFinally, openness to trade also means openness to international flows of capital. Foreign investments\nin the United States may be in a physical form (for example, BMW's factory in South Carolina) or in a\nfinancial form (for example, foreign purchases of the stock and bond offerings of U.S. companies).\nEither type of foreign investment supports business expansion and employment domestically.\nIf trade both destroys jobs and creates jobs, what is the overall effect of an open trading system on\ndomestic employment? Both economic theory and the available evidence strongly suggest that trade\nhas little net effect on the economy's capacity to employ its workforce. In the long run, the workings of\na competitive labor market, assisted perhaps by appropriate economic policies, ensure that jobs will\nbe created that are commensurate with the size of the labor force and the available mix of worker\nskills. Thus, in the long run, factors such as population growth, education and training, labor force\nparticipation rates, and labor market institutions determine the level and composition of aggregate\nemployment.\nIn contrast, trade appears to have essentially no role in determining a country's long-run employment\npotential. To illustrate, between 1960 and 2003, the U.S. trade balance went from a small surplus (that\nis, an excess of exports over imports) to a large deficit, equal to about 4-1/2 percent of gross domestic\nproduct (GDP). At the same time, the United States became a much more open economy; in dollar\nterms, imports (measured on a balance of payments basis) rose from just over 4 percent of GDP in\n1960 to nearly 14 percent of GDP today. Yet the current unemployment rate of 5.6 percent is little\nchanged from its level of 5.5 percent in 1960 - a year in which, much like today, the economy was in\nthe recovery phase from a recession. And of course, aggregate employment in the United States has\ngrown greatly since 1960, by more than 60 million jobs. This increase in employment is significantly\nfaster, by the way, than the growth of the population over the same period, in large part because of\nincreased labor force participation by women. Evidently, increased exposure to trade notwithstanding,\nover the years the American economy has been able to generate the jobs needed to accommodate\nmillions of new entrants to the labor force.\nEvidence from international comparisons also runs strongly counter to the view that trade depresses\naggregate employment. Notably, despite its large trade deficit, the United States has experienced a\nsignificantly greater expansion in employment over the past decade than either Germany or Japan,\nboth of which have enjoyed perennial trade surpluses.\nAlthough the labor force and labor-market institutions determine employment in the long run, short-run\ncyclical influences, such as transitory changes in spending or productivity, may cause employment to\ndeviate from its long-run sustainable level. Even in the short run, however, there is no discernable link\nbetween aggregate employment and changes in trade volumes or the trade balance. For example,\nover the past two decades, even as U.S. trade has expanded rapidly, the quarter-to-quarter volatility of\nboth output and employment has decreased noticeably, and recessions have become less frequent\nand milder than in earlier decades (Bernanke, 2004). In recent years, the sharpest deterioration in the\nU.S. trade balance occurred between 1997 and 2000, a time during which domestic employment was\ngrowing at a rapid pace.\nMy focus thus far on the net effect of trade on jobs ignores the fact that those who lose jobs for\ntrade-related reasons are not necessarily the same people who get the new jobs created by trade.\nTrade, like other factors resulting in structural change, can have noticeable effects on the mix of jobs\nacross industries, skill levels, and locations. Those who lose jobs, whatever the cause of the\ndislocation, have real reason to be unhappy, because job loss often entails economic hardship - a\npoint that I will shortly discuss in more detail. However, in our dynamic economy, jobs are created and\ndestroyed in great numbers all the time. How important are trade-related factors in this ongoing\nprocess of job creation and destruction?\nTo address the key area of public concern, I will focus here on the job-loss side of the equation.\nEstimates of the gross number of job losses associated with increased import penetration vary widely,\nbut one representative calculation, by Lori Kletzer (2001), put the gross job loss due to imports at\nnearly 310,000 per year for the period from 1979 to 1999. I stress that Kletzer's estimate of gross job\nloss ignores any jobs created by trade, either directly or indirectly.\nThe amount of \"churn\" in the U.S. labor market is enormous, a reflection of the continuous stream of\nentry, exit, and resizing of firms in our ever-changing economy. In order to get some perspective on\nKletzer's estimate of trade-induced job loss, then, we should compare it to the number of workers who\nare displaced each year in the United States for all reasons, including firm or plant closings, corporate\nrestructuring, automation, or the ending of fixed-term employment. According to the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics (BLS), over the past ten years, gross job losses in the United States have averaged about\n7.7 million jobs per quarter.4 Multiplying 7.7 million by four suggests that about 31 million U.S. jobs are\neliminated each year. Research suggests, however, that because this number includes temporary\nlayoffs, seasonal closings, and other job losses that are reversed within the year, it overstates\nlonger-term job losses by about double (Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh, 1996). Hence, a reasonably\nconservative estimate is that, excluding seasonal and other short-term layoffs, about 15 million jobs\nare lost each year in the United States, equal to nearly 14 percent of the current level of nonfarm\nprivate employment. Of course, because net private-sector job creation in the United States over the\npast ten years has averaged more than 1.8 million per year, these losses were more than offset by the\ncreation of about 17 million jobs per year during the same period. Truly, the U.S. labor market exhibits\na phenomenal capacity for creative destruction.\nComparing the 310,000 or so gross job losses per year that Kletzer (2001) attributes to increased\nimports to the 15 million total job losses, we find that only slightly more than 2 percent of gross job\nlosses are the result of import competition. In other words, for the typical job loser during the past ten\nyears, the chances are 98 percent that some factor other than competition from imports was the\nprincipal reason for displacement.\nKletzer's calculations apply to the longer period since 1979. What about the current situation?\nAlthough U.S. employment stagnated for an extended period after the recovery got under way and has\nrecently risen only slowly, there is little basis for blaming the recent poor employment performance on\nimport competition. Indeed, as a share of GDP, imports to the United States have actually fallen since\n2000, from 14.7 percent of GDP in 2000 to 13.7 percent in 2003. The worsening of the U.S. trade\ndeficit as a share of GDP in recent years is entirely due to a fall in exports, from 10.9 percent of GDP\nin 2000 to 9.3 percent of GDP in 2003. Thus, to the extent that trade patterns are contributing at all to\nthe current weakness in employment, the more relevant concern is that foreign economies are not\ngrowing as fast as our own and hence are not generating as much demand for our exports as we\nwould like.\nEven if the overall level of employment is largely unaffected by trade, some have argued that trade\nadversely affects the composition of jobs, for example, by replacing relatively high-paid manufacturing\njobs with lower-paid service-sector jobs. I will return shortly to the issue of why manufacturing\nemployment has declined in the United States. I only note here that little evidence supports the view\nthat trade has an adverse effect on wages or the mix of jobs in the economy as a whole. In particular,\nthe often-expressed view that the ongoing shift of jobs from manufacturing to services has depressed\nearnings does not seem generally to be true. For example, during the 1990s, average earnings in\nmanufacturing industries that showed net declines in employment (weighted by the number of job\nlosses) were $10.63 per hour. During the same period, wages in expanding service-providing\nindustries (weighted by the number of job gains) were $11.26 per hour, about 6 percent higher.\nWhat about outsourcing abroad?\nThe debate about the effects of trade on employment has been intensified recently by an upsurge in\ntrade in business services, popularly referred to as outsourcing abroad, or \"offshoring.\"5 New interest\nby U.S. corporations in outsourcing white-collar activities has been driven by several factors, including\nimprovements in international communications; the computerization and digitization of some business\nservices; and the existence of educated, often English-speaking, workers abroad who will perform\nsimilar services for less pay. When feasible, offshoring has obvious attractions for business.\nComparative wage data suggest why. Estimated average wages for software developers are $6 per\nhour in India, compared with $60 per hour in the United States (McKinsey Global Institute, 2003).\nSimilarly, average wages for telephone operators are estimated to be less than $1 per hour in India\nand about $12.50 per hour in the United States (Bardhan and Kroll, 2003). (A portion, but certainly not\nall, of these wage differentials reflects differences in skills; for example, programmers in India\ngenerally perform simpler and more routine tasks than do those in the United States.)\nThe increase in outsourcing abroad - particularly of activities previously considered immune to foreign\ncompetition - has led to dire predictions about a wholesale \"export\" of U.S. jobs in coming years.\nAlthough globalization will continue to be a force for economic change, the pace of change is likely to\nbe slower than implied by such predictions. Outsourcing abroad has proved profitable primarily for jobs\nthat can be routinized and sharply defined. For the foreseeable future, most high-value work will\nrequire creative interaction among employees, interaction that is facilitated by physical proximity,\npersonal contact, and shared cultural experiences. Moreover, in many fields, closeness to customers\nand knowledge of local conditions are also of great importance. These observations suggest that, for\nsome considerable time, outsourcing abroad will be uneconomical for many types of jobs, particularly\nhigh-value jobs.6\nFundamentally, the outsourcing of business services abroad is not a new phenomenon. In an\nincreasingly interdependent world economy, trade in services, like trade in goods, is being harnessed\nto the goals of cutting costs and expanding production. That outsourcing abroad benefits the receivers\nas well as the providers of outsourced services has been shown by empirical studies. For example,\nCatherine Mann (2004) has estimated that outsourcing abroad has reduced prices of IT hardware\n10 to 30 percent, boosting the diffusion of information technology throughout the U.S. economy and\nraising both productivity and growth by a very significant amount - 0.3 percentage point per year.7 The\nMcKinsey Global Institute (2003) finds that for every dollar of activity outsourced to India, the United\nStates receives between $1.12 and $1.14 in economic benefits.8\nAs with trade in general, it is useful to ask how much outsourcing abroad contributes to gross job loss\nin the United States. Unfortunately, as with trade in general, measures of gross job loss associated\nwith outsourcing abroad are scarce. An analysis by Goldman-Sachs (2003) estimated that U.S\nproducers shifted between 300,000 and 500,000 jobs abroad during the past three years, an average\nof between 100,000 and 167,000 jobs per year since 2000. This estimate includes jobs both inside\nand outside manufacturing (that is, it includes both goods and services) and reflects increased imports\nfrom foreign affiliates of U.S. corporations. Based on this analysis, Goldman-Sachs argues that, over\nthe next several years, offshoring of business services may rise to several hundred thousand jobs per\nyear. Again, to gain perspective, we should compare these estimates with the overall rate of job\ndisplacement in the United States. Two hundred thousand jobs per year amount to a bit more than\n1 percent of the 15 million or so jobs that are lost each year in the U.S. economy for all reasons.\nQuantitatively, outsourcing abroad simply cannot account for much of the recent weakness in the U.S.\nlabor market and does not appear likely to be an important restraint to further recovery in employment.\nMoreover, a balanced discussion of outsourcing abroad should reflect the fact that, just as U.S. firms\nuse the services of foreigners, foreign firms make considerable use of the services of U.S. residents.\nAn underappreciated fact is that, in contrast to its trade deficit in goods, the United States runs a\nsignificant trade surplus in services. The official trade data do not have direct measures of outsourcing\nof services abroad, but much of what we would consider offshoring is likely included under the heading\n\"Business, Professional, and Technical Services,\" a category of trade in services.9 In 2002, the latest\nyear for which complete data are available, the United States exported nearly $29 billion in business\nservices. Against these exports, U.S. imports of business services in 2002 totaled less than $11 billion\n(about 0.1 of 1 percent of U.S. GDP), for an overall surplus in business services trade of $18 billion.\nMoreover, U.S. exports of business services have increased $3.5 billion since 2000, a period during\nwhich imports of business services increased only $2 billion.10 An important reason for the U.S. trade\nsurplus in business services is that this country provides many high-value services to users abroad,\nincluding financial, legal, engineering, architectural, and software development services, while many of\nthe services imported by U.S. companies are less sophisticated and hence of lower cost.\nAs discussions of the outsourcing of business services tend to ignore the large amount of \"insourcing\"\nof services to the United States from other countries, so do discussions of American firms moving jobs\nabroad ignore the fact that foreign firms also move jobs to the United States. Between 1997 and 2001\n(the most recent data available), employment of U.S. residents by affiliates of foreign companies\noperating within the United States increased by about 1.2 million jobs. In 2001, U.S. affiliates of foreign\ncompanies accounted for nearly $500 billion in gross output (about half in manufacturing) and about\n$164 billion in exports. Globalization and outsourcing work both ways.\nSo why is the recovery jobless?\nWe have little evidence to show that trade in general, or outsourcing abroad in particular, is a major\nsource of net job loss. Yet, two-and-a-half years into the economic recovery, the pace of job creation\n7\nComparing data for 1999 and 2003 to eliminate the largest effects of the high-tech boom- and-bust cycle, Mann also shows\nthat U.S. employment in several white-collar occupations related to IT or deemed vulnerable to IT-enabled outsourcing has\nin fact been stable or expanded modestly.\n8\nAlthough my focus today is on the United States, we should not ignore the benefits of outsourcing to countries that provide\nthese services. Software developers and telephone operators who provide offshore services from a country such as India\nare afforded a precious opportunity for economic advancement, and their country as a whole becomes richer, more\ncompetitive, and more integrated into the world trading system. Moreover, outsourced service jobs do not typically bring\nalong collateral issues of potential environmental damage and poor working conditions that have concerned some critics of\nexpanded trade.\n9\nSome components of this category probably contain little outsourcing, for example, construction services, whereas some\ncategories outside Business, Professional, and Technical Services, for example, telecommunications, may contain\nsignificant amounts of outsourced services. None of the conclusions drawn in the text is changed by considering the\nsubcategories in greater detail.\n10\nIn the broader category of Other Private Services, of which Business, Technical, and Professional Services is a subset, in\n2003 the United States had a trade surplus of $53.6 billion, up from $41.7 billion in 1997.\nBIS Review 19/2004\nin the United States has been distressingly slow. Job losses in manufacturing have been particularly\ndeep, with employment in that sector apparently only now beginning to stabilize after falling by almost\n3 million jobs since 2000. Why has the recovery been largely jobless thus far?\nIn a speech presented last November (Bernanke, 2003), I discussed a number of factors underlying\nthe reluctance of U.S. firms to increase their workforces. I concluded then, and continue to believe,\nthat the single most important factor explaining lagging job creation is the astonishing gains in labor\nproductivity that have been achieved in the U.S. economy in the past few years. According to the\nBureau of Labor Statistics, labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased 4.3 percent in\n2002 and 5.4 percent in 2003. For comparison, productivity advanced at an average rate of\n2.5 percent per year from 1996 to 2000, a period that was viewed at the time to be one of\nexceptionally strong productivity growth. Most economists would agree that new information and\ncommunication technologies, together with organizational changes facilitated by those technologies,\nhave been an important source of these impressive productivity gains. Note that, because the\nproductivity figures are based on measures of domestically produced output and domestic\nemployment, to a first approximation cost savings reflected by outsourcing abroad are not reflected in,\nand thus cannot explain, the recent surge in productivity.11\nThe gains in domestic labor productivity are great news for Americans in the long run, as they will\npromote higher wages, profits, and living standards in this country. In the short term, however,\nincreased productivity has permitted the U.S. business sector to meet strong final demand for its\noutput without having to hire significant numbers of new workers. The effect of productivity gains has\nbeen particularly marked in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Productivity gains of 3.8 percent in 2001,\n6.4 percent in 2002, and 5.8 percent in 2003 (as reported by the BLS) have permitted U.S.\nmanufacturers to reach levels of production only about two percent below the cyclical peak in\nmid-2000, despite the sharp decline in employment.12 The general trend toward higher productivity\nand decreased employment in manufacturing has been observed for decades in the United States,\nalthough the process has recently intensified. Other countries have had similar experiences. For\nexample, while U.S. manufacturing employment has declined 18 percent since 1990, the comparable\nfigure for Japan is nearly 22 percent and for the United Kingdom it is more than 27 percent.\nDeveloping countries have experienced a similar pattern. Even China, supposedly the destination of\nU.S. manufacturing jobs, has seen manufacturing employment shrink by more than 15 percent since\nits peak in 1995.13\nThe long-run trend in manufacturing in the United States and other industrialized countries is similar to\nwhat occurred earlier in agriculture. At one time a majority of the U.S. population lived on farms.\nHowever, agricultural productivity has improved so much over the years that, although farm workers\nmake up only about 2-1/2 percent of the workforce, they are able both to feed the nation and (as noted\nearlier) export substantial quantities of food as well.\nWhen will the U.S. economy begin to create jobs in significant numbers? The recent rates of\nproductivity growth are unprecedented, and hence likely unsustainable. Thus, if output growth\ncontinues at its current robust pace, job creation will surely follow. However, because we do not know\nexactly how either productivity or aggregate spending will evolve, predicting the timing of a jobs\nresurgence is difficult. Although, like many economists, I have been surprised by the unusually slow\nrecovery of the labor market, I continue to believe that steady improvement in the labor market over\nthe remainder of this year is the most likely outcome.\nWhat can policy do?\nI have argued today that, in general, increased trade does not reduce employment and, more\nspecifically, that trade bears little responsibility for the recent slow pace of job creation in the United\nStates. Moreover, the economy taken as a whole clearly benefits from trade.\nStill, as I have noted, to say that the U.S. economy benefits from trade is not to say that every\nindividual American worker or family benefits, or that the structural changes induced by trade are not\ndisruptive. Clearly, some workers who have been displaced or have had a difficult time finding work\nduring the past three years can accurately claim to have been made worse off by international\ncompetition. Job loss in particular causes significant hardships for affected workers. For example, an\nanalysis by Henry Farber (2003), using BLS data on workers displaced for any reason, suggests that\nonly about two-thirds of displaced workers found re-employment within three years, with some settling\nfor part-time work. Even when successful in finding full-time work, displaced workers experience on\naverage a decline in earnings on the new job of about 8 percent. Focusing on workers displaced by\ntrade in particular, Kletzer (2001) found that job losers in industries facing high levels of import\ncompetition were slightly less likely to be re-employed and experienced greater earnings losses, at\nabout 13 percent on average, than workers displaced from industries facing less import competition.\nWhat can be done to help workers who lose their jobs because of competition from imports? Attempts\nto restrict trade through the imposition of tariffs, quotas, or other trade barriers are not a good solution.\nSuch actions may temporarily slow job loss in affected industries. But they do so by imposing on the\noverall economy costs that typically are many times greater than the benefits. In the short run, the\ncosts of trade barriers include higher prices for consumers and higher costs (and thus reduced\ncompetitiveness) for U.S. firms. Trade barriers typically provoke retaliation from trading partners as\nwell, with potentially large costs for exporters. And history shows that in the longer run, economic\nisolationism and retreat from international competition lead to bloated, inefficient industries, lower\nproductivity, and lower living standards.\nThe better policy approach is two-pronged. First, at the macro level, policy should be directed at\nhelping to ensure that jobs become available for those who have been displaced. In particular, over\ntime, appropriate monetary policies can help the economy achieve maximum employment with low\ninflation, irrespective of the trade situation. The nation's trade policies, rather than attempting to restrict\ntrade, should be used to push for even more trade. By opening markets abroad, trade policy provides\ngreater opportunities for U.S. firms and workers.\nThe second piece of a constructive policy toward trade is to help displaced workers train for and find\nnew work. Some steps in this direction have been taken. Currently, the government's principal\nprogram for helping workers displaced by trade is the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, or TAA.\nThe Congress has recently extended the TAA through 2007, while adding a special TAA program for\nolder workers and a separate TAA program for farmers. The TAA program offers up to two and a half\nyears of job training, allowances for job search and relocation, and income support for eligible workers,\nthe latter for up to 104 weeks after the initial 26 weeks of conventional unemployment insurance\nbenefits have been exhausted. The recently passed legislation also provides for health insurance\nassistance for some eligible workers. The U.S. Department of Labor certified about 208,000 workers\nfor trade adjustment assistance during fiscal year 2003, spending $551 million on the program. Finally,\nalthough current TAA legislation is generally interpreted to apply only to jobs displaced in\nmanufacturing, bills to extend TAA to service-sector workers were introduced this month in both the\nHouse and Senate.\nTAA is certainly not a perfect program. A recent report by the General Accounting Office (2001)\ndescribed the challenges of effectively retraining older, less-educated workers. It noted also that TAA\ndoes not address all the problems of communities that have suffered from plant closings and the like.\nMore general criticisms can be raised about the program: First, in a complex and interdependent\neconomy, identifying workers affected by trade is not always a straightforward matter. Second, one\nmay well wonder why workers displaced by trade should be assisted but not workers displaced by\nother factors, such as restructuring or automation.\nLately, a number of proposals have been advanced to help displaced workers more generally,\nincluding changes in law that increase the portability of pension and health benefits. Other proposals\ninclude a program of \"wage insurance,\" which would help to cushion the wage loss that often occurs\nwhen job losers take new jobs (Kletzer and Litan, 2001) and tax credits for firms that invest in worker\ntraining (Mann, 2003, 2004). Time does not permit me to evaluate these and other alternative\nproposals today. Instead I will conclude by noting that helping displaced workers is good policy for at\nleast three reasons. First, reducing the burdens borne by displaced workers is the right and fair thing\nto do. Second, helping workers who have lost jobs find new productive work is good for the economy\nas well as for the affected workers and their families. Finally, if workers are less fearful of change, less\npressure will be exerted on politicians to erect trade barriers or to take other actions that would reduce\nthe flexibility and dynamism of the U.S. economy.14 In the long run, avoiding economic isolationism\nand maintaining economic dynamism will pay big dividends for everybody.",

         "Edward M Gramlich: Budget and trade deficits - linked, both worrisome in the\nlong run, but not twins\nRemarks by Mr Edward M Gramlich, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Los Angeles Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics Luncheon,\nLos Angeles, 31 March 2004.\nPresented at the Euromoney Bond Investors Congress, London, England, 25 February 2004.\n* * *\nThank you for inviting me to speak today. While I know that most of you would welcome any insights I\nmight have about current U.S. monetary policy - whether the Open Market Committee will be raising or\nlowering interest rates at our next meeting - I prefer to focus instead on some issues that could\nbecome serious over the longer run. These issues involve the persistent budget and trade deficits\nfacing the American economy, issues that could eventually involve significant economic adjustments\naround the world.1\nLarge budget and trade deficits are not a new phenomenon. They also arose in the United States in\nthe mid-1980s. At that time, the business press and many economists began referring to the situation\nas one of \"twin deficits.\" With the current re-emergence of both deficits, the phrase has come back into\ncommon usage - too common, in my view.\nTo be sure, in theoretical models there is a scenario by which budget deficits can create trade deficits,\nand one by which trade deficits can create budget deficits. But there are also many scenarios by which\neither deficit can arise independently, or even by which budget and trade deficits can move in opposite\ndirections, as they did in the 1990s. In general, while budget and trade deficits can be linked, there are\nimportant differences between the two, both in how they respond to economic forces and in their\nlong-run consequences.\nI start by examining the relationship between budget and trade deficits - why they are linked but not\ntwins. I discuss the sustainability conditions for budget and trade deficits; the conditions that must be\nfulfilled for the debts on both accounts to be stabilized in relation to the size of the U.S. economy.\nThen I discuss what happens if either debt violates this condition and rises in relation to the size of the\neconomy. This discussion, in turn, raises further interesting distinctions between the two deficits.\nThe link\nThe link between budget and trade deficits can be seen most naturally through the national income\naccounting framework. Any saving the nation does finances either private domestic investment directly\nor the accumulation of claims on foreigners. This means that national saving - the sum of private and\ngovernment saving - equals private domestic investment plus that period's accumulation of claims on\nforeigners, or the trade surplus. The trade surplus can also be thought of as net foreign lending. All of\nthese relationships are accounting identities - true at every moment in time apart from data\ninconsistencies captured by a statistical discrepancy.\nIn equation form, we have\n(1) NS = S - BD = I - TD\nOn the left side of the equation NS refers to national saving, S refers to overall private saving, and BD\nrefers to the government budget deficit. This part of the equation says merely that total national saving\nequals the sum of all saving done in the economy by the private sector and the government sector. A\nbudget surplus would be treated as governmental saving and added to private saving; a budget deficit\nwould be treated as governmental dissaving and subtracted.\nThe right side of the equation repeats the familiar open economy identity that national saving equals\nprivate domestic investment, I, plus the accumulation of claims on foreigners or less that domestic\ninvestment financed by foreigners. As was noted earlier, borrowing from foreigners involves either a\nreduction of claims on them or an increase of claims on us by them. It is by definition equal to the\ntrade deficit TD. In the equation, then, a trade surplus means that some national saving goes to\nbuilding up claims on foreigners (national saving is greater than domestic investment) while a trade\ndeficit means that some investment is financed by foreigners (national saving is less than domestic\ninvestment).\nThis identity first demonstrates the all-important role of national saving in shaping long-run economic\nwelfare. National saving is the only way a country can have its capital and own it too. Models of the\neconomic growth process identify national saving as one of the key policy variables in influencing a\nnation's living standards in the long run.\nThe identity also makes clear that the budget deficit and the trade deficit can move together on a\ndollar-per-dollar basis, but only if the difference between private domestic investment and private\nsaving is constant. Typically that difference will not be constant. For example, if there were to be an\ninvestment boom, interest rates might rise to induce some new private saving and some new lending\nby foreigners. The implied trade deficit might rise and, because of the rise in income, the budget deficit\nmight fall. In this case, the trade deficit would increase while the budget deficit fell.\nConversely, suppose that expansionary fiscal policy resulted in a rise in budget deficits. If this\nexpansion were totally financed by borrowing from foreigners, domestic interest rates would not\nchange much, and domestic investment and private saving might not either. In this scenario, there\ncould be a simultaneous dollar-per-dollar change in budget and trade deficits - the classic twin-deficit\nscenario. Such a situation is most likely to occur in small economies fully open to international trade\nand capital flows, economies in which domestic interest rates are determined by world capital markets\nand are independent of domestic economic variables. But if domestic interest rates do change, as they\nlikely would in either a closed economy or a large open economy, private investment and saving would\nalso likely change, and any strict link between budget and trade deficits would be broken.\nOne could spin any number of scenarios, but these are enough to make the basic point. Because of\nthe underlying relationship between saving and investment, budget and trade deficits could be strictly\nlinked. But in a large open economy like the United States, it is easy to imagine plenty of scenarios in\nwhich they are imperfectly linked, and even some scenarios in which they move in opposite directions.\nBudget and trade deficits should be viewed as linked, but not as twins.\nStability conditions\nAlthough the economic implications and reactions of budget deficits and trade deficits differ, both are\ndeficits. Another elementary accounting identity says that last period's debt level plus the current\ndeficit equals the current period's debt level. This identity is true whether we are talking about budget\ndeficits building up the stock of outstanding government debt (a liability of the government sector to\nthe private sector), or trade deficits building up the stock of external debt (the net stock of accumulated\nforeign claims against the United States).2\nEconomists have worried for years about optimal stocks of government and external debt. For\ngovernment debt, the optimal stock turns out to be related to the optimal level of national saving, which\ncan be defined as the level that maximizes the nation's long-term path of consumption per worker. The\noptimal stock of net external debt can be determined in the same framework from an open economy\nperspective.\nWhile these models can be instructive, today I am going to focus on a weaker standard. Whatever the\nlong-term optimal level of government debt, and whatever the optimal level of external debt, one can\nseparately ask whether either debt level is becoming a more, or less, important economic factor over\ntime. For government debt, this weaker standard, or stability condition, determines merely whether the\nratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) is stable. If it is, interest payments on the debt will, in\nequilibrium, also settle down to a stable proportion of GDP. For external debt, a stable debt-to-GDP\nratio means that the net interest and dividend payments of the United States to foreign investors will\nalso settle down to a constant ratio to GDP.\nThe appendix derives this stability condition generically. It is that\nd\n(2) (g - i)/(1 + g) = p,\nwhere d is the stable ratio of debt to GDP, g is the nominal growth rate of the economy, i is the\nnominal interest rate in the economy, and p is the ratio of the primary deficit to GDP. For budget\naccounts, the primary deficit is the national income accounts budget deficit, but excluding interest\npayments. For trade accounts, the primary trade deficit is the current account deficit, excluding net\ninterest and dividend payments to foreigners.3\nAs a general rule, the economy's growth rate and interest rate will be fairly close. The equation says\nthat if they are equal, the primary deficit must be zero to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. If the interest\nrate is slightly above the growth rate, as it would be in models without risk for economies that save\nless than the theoretical optimum, a nation with outstanding debt would have to run a slight primary\nsurplus to stabilize its debt-to-GDP ratio. If the effective interest rate on debt is slightly below the\ngrowth rate, as it has generally been found to be in the past for both deficits, a nation with outstanding\ndebt could run slight primary deficits and not see the debt ratio grow.4\nOn the foreign side, this condition has until now been especially forgiving. Even with a large net debt\nposition, our net investment income from foreigners has exceeded that paid out to foreigners. Since\nthe net interest rate has been less than the GDP growth rate, the ratio of external debt to GDP could\nhave been stabilized with a moderate primary trade deficit.5\nMagnitudes\nIt is well known that the U.S. economy now suffers both budget and trade deficits. But how do these\ndeficits compare with the stability conditions?\nHistorically, there have not been significant instabilities in U.S. federal budget deficits.6 Overall deficits\nhave averaged about 2 percent of GDP over the past four decades, but figure 1 shows that when\ninterest is deducted, primary budget deficits have averaged close to zero, the approximate level that\nstabilizes the debt-to-GDP ratio. Hence, the outstanding debt, while fluctuating in the range of\n25 percent to 50 percent of GDP, has actually declined slightly as a share of GDP. It was 38 percent of\nGDP in the mid-1960s and is now only 37 percent of GDP. The ratio did rise as high as 50 percent in\nthe high-deficit years of the early 1990s, but it dropped sharply thereafter with the primary budget\nsurpluses of the late 1990s.\nLooking ahead, things might not be so favorable. As a result of recent fiscal changes, the budget has\nlately fallen into primary deficit again; this primary deficit is now more than 2 percent of GDP\n(1.5 percent after cyclical adjustment). The deterioration reflects the much-discussed recent rapid\ngrowth in expenditures, along with significant tax cuts. Perhaps more significant, in a few years the\nUnited States will face huge looming costs for retirement and health programs. It will take\nextraordinary fiscal discipline just to keep the present primary deficit near its current level of 1 to\n2 percent of GDP over the short, medium, and long run. And even at that level, the stability condition is\nviolated by at least 1 percent of GDP, suggesting that the debt-to-GDP ratio is likely to climb steadily\nupward.7\n3\nThis primary trade deficit differs from the trade deficit component of GDP mentioned earlier because it includes foreign\ntransfers and other small items.\n4\nLaurence Ball, Douglas W. Elmendorf, and N. Gregory Mankiw, \"The Deficit Gamble,\" Journal of Money, Credit, and\nBanking, vol. 30, no. 4, (November 1998), pp. 699-720, show that interest rates on domestic government debt have\ngenerally been slightly less than the GDP growth rate in past decades.\n5\nThe rate-of-return puzzle is in turn a question about why foreign direct investment in the United States has such a low rate\nof return. See Raymond J. Mataloni, Jr., \"An Examination of the Low Rates of Return of Foreign-Owned U.S. Companies,\"\nSurvey of Current Business, vol. 80 (March 2000), pp. 55-73.\n6\nEven though the previous identity referred to the consumption budget for the entire government sector, in this section I\nswitch over to the familiar concept of the total budget for the U.S. federal government. State and local governments more or\nless finance their current spending and do not have much outstanding debt apart from that backed by capital formation; and\nfederal capital investment is very small.\n7\nThese statements are based on estimates of the Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook, Fiscal\nYears 2005 to 2014 (January 2004). A further discussion of the long-run budget outlook can be found in Alan J. Auerbach,\nBIS Review 19/2004\nOn the trade side, figure 2 shows that the trend is definitely more worrisome. While the budget debt\nhas fluctuated between 25 percent and 50 percent of GDP over the past several decades, the net\nexternal debt has grown steadily. Until 1985, this external debt was not even positive; that is, until that\ntime the United States had net claims on foreigners. But because the United States has run persistent\nand sizable primary trade deficits since 1990, the net external debt is now 25 percent of GDP and\nrising sharply. The primary trade deficit is now 5 percent of GDP, violating the stability condition by\nnearly this same amount. At this rate, the external debt ratio will climb very quickly.\nWhile the trade deficit does have equilibrating tendencies, as will be discussed later, there are also\nforces that tend to increase it. Econometric studies of the basic demand for imports and exports find\nthat the U.S. income elasticity of demand for imports is higher than the foreign income elasticity of\ndemand for U.S. exports. This means that even if the world economy grows at the same rate as the\nU.S. economy, our trade deficit is likely to widen, (apart from any changes in relative prices).8 Indeed,\nthe U.S. primary trade deficit has widened steadily since 1990.\nAdjustments\nI have just argued that the U.S. is now in violation of the stability condition for both budget and trade\ndeficits - recently and moderately on the budget side, persistently and significantly on the trade side.\nWhat are the implications?\nWith each deficit there is probably a credibility range. By that, I mean a limited range within which a\ncountry may be able to violate its stability condition and have its debt-to-GDP ratio trend upward\nwithout further economic consequences. For budgets, there may be a range within which the\ndebt-to-GDP ratio can grow without significant changes in interest rates.9 As equation 1 indicates,\neconomic performance in this range is by no means optimal, because the persistent deficits are\nsubtracting funds that would otherwise be devoted to capital investment and future growth in living\nstandards. But there may not be significant relative price effects. The same is true on the trade side;\nthere could be a range in which foreign claims on the United States just build up without major impact\non relative prices.\nOnce the economy gets outside of the credibility range, more significant relative price adjustments\nbecome likely. On the trade side, for example, the continued accumulation of foreign claims on the\nU.S. economy will raise the issue of whether foreign investors will want to hold an ever-increasing\nshare of their wealth in the form of U.S. assets. Or, as is the focus of the stability condition above,\nwhether the U.S. economy can indefinitely pay out ever-higher shares of GDP in the form of interest\nand dividend payments. The conventional view is that at some point there should be a relative price\nadjustment - some combination of rising U.S. interest rates (to make U.S. assets more attractive),\nrising foreign prices (to make imports more expensive), moderating U.S. prices (to make U.S. exports\nmore competitive), or a change in exchange rates. Each of these reactions is likely to occur naturally,\nand each moves in the direction of lowering the external imbalance. That is why foreign trade deficits\nare typically thought of as self-correcting. The main risk here is that the natural adjustments may not\noccur gradually, but so rapidly as to threaten various types of dislocations.\nThere are complicating factors. One involves the currency denomination of the net debt. Countries\nwith large trade deficits often have their external liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Hence,\nwhen their own currency depreciates, the value and burden of foreign debt automatically increases.\nThe United States does not have this problem because most of its debt is denominated in dollars -\nsay, foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury bills. If the dollar were to fall, the value of our debt in terms of\nforeign currencies would then automatically decline, inducing foreign wealth-holders to make further\nportfolio shifts, perhaps even including increasing their stock of dollar-denominated debt. This\ndenomination effect would not permanently prevent any relative price adjustment, but it could lengthen\nthe process.\nBeyond that, for pragmatic reasons this conventional adjustment process could be extended or\ndistorted even further. By way of illustration, Asian central banks have now accumulated more than a\ntrillion dollars of international currency reserves - largely in dollar-denominated assets - equal to\nroughly half of the outstanding net debt of the United States. These central banks are not traditional\nwealth-holders motivated by expected risks and returns. Instead, they seem motivated more by the\nprospect of preserving low domestic currency values for their exporters.10 To pursue this objective,\nthey can print money to buy U.S. securities. This monetary expansion could generate domestic\ninflation unless it is sterilized with other open market sales of securities - and the mere scale of\npresent and expected future debt stocks may make continued sterilization impossible. But if these\ncentral banks continue behaving this way, the so-called credibility range could be extended\nsignificantly.\nWhile trade deficits should ultimately correct themselves, perhaps after a long trek through the\ncredibility range, there are really no natural self-corrective mechanisms for budget deficits. Once the\nU.S. economy gets through the credibility range, interest rates on the increasing government debt will\nhave to rise to induce people to hold the debt. This rise increases the interest burden and causes total\ndeficits to rise further, all the time subtracting more and more funds from capital accumulation. Once\nthis process begins, market psychology may hasten the adjustment.11 Hence, while natural forces\nlessen the basic external imbalance, they increase the basic budget imbalance. In the long run, the\nonly way to correct budget deficits is for policymakers to correct them.\nOutside forces\nThere are several outside forces - both natural and as a result of policy - that could influence budget\nand trade deficits.\nOne generally helpful influence is productivity growth. Say the U.S. economy benefits from an\nexogenous positive shock to productivity growth, as it seemed to have in the late 1990s. This shock\nwould raise the trend path of income, meaning that slightly higher primary budget and trade deficits\ncould still be consistent with debt-to-GDP stability; in effect, a higher level of g can be plugged into\nequation 2 (at least as long as it is not offset by a higher i). Higher productivity could also help\nlengthen the credibility range, the range in which moderate changes in the debt ratio might not lead to\nadverse changes in relative prices. Among other things, higher productivity could raise the marginal\nproduct of capital and make investment in U.S. assets relatively attractive. But even with these\nfavorable developments, the stability conditions discussed above still hold. If they are violated, the\nnatural adjustment mechanisms will eventually take over for the trade deficit, and the primary budget\ndeficit will eventually have to be reduced to stop a growing government debt ratio.\nOne unhelpful measure is trade protectionism. While it might appear that trade protectionism would\ncorrect trade deficits, it probably will not. Over the medium and long run, the economy should be\nproducing near its natural growth path, perhaps because of timely monetary and/or fiscal policy,\nperhaps because of natural equilibrating forces in the economy. In this event, trade protectionism\nwould not stimulate added national production. Even if protectionist measures reduce imports, the\nadded spending demands for import-competing industries will crowd out other types of production. Put\nanother way, equation 1 shows that the trade deficit is ultimately determined by national saving and\ninvestment. Without a change in these, protectionism merely shifts the types of goods that are\nproduced. It does not increase overall production and, short of cutting off trade altogether, does not\neven change the trade balance. Moreover, as is well known, over the long run, trade protection lowers\na nation's standard of living.\nFinally, suppose politicians actually do correct budget deficits, again assuming an economy near its\nmedium-term growth path. As mentioned above, such a fiscal austerity policy is the only known way to\ncorrect persistent budget deficits. The reduction in deficits should lower domestic interest rates and\ntrigger changes in exchange rates that lower imports and raise exports. Hence, well-designed fiscal\nausterity measures could solve all the problems simultaneously. They correct budget deficits directly,\nthey reduce trade deficits indirectly, and the implied higher level of national saving also permits more\nfunds to flow into capital formation and long-term productivity enhancements. Fiscal austerity is the\none tried and true approach to dealing with budget and trade deficits simultaneously.\nConclusions\nThere are obviously strong links between budget and trade deficits, and the deficit-debt dynamic\nrelationships are very similar. At the same time, it is misleading simply to equate the two deficits, as is\noften done in the twin-deficit literature. Budget deficits typically involve a reduction in national saving\nand, if large, a steadily growing government debt-to-GDP ratio. They typically will not be corrected\nwithout explicit action. Trade deficits, on the other hand, typically involve an increase in foreign claims\non the U.S. economy. As these claims grow in relation to national income, at least some natural forces\nare set in motion to correct the imbalance.\nFrom a policy standpoint, neither deficit may be terribly harmful in the short run, and at least the recent\nfiscal deficits have been useful in stabilizing movements in output. Moreover, there is likely to be a\ncredibility range in which debt levels could rise relative to GDP without much change in relative prices.\nIn the long run, however, both deficits could become much more worrisome. There are forces tending\nto increase both deficits: political and demographic for budget deficits, income elasticities for trade\ndeficits. At some point, continued large-scale trade deficits could trigger equilibrating, and possibly\ndislocating, changes in prices, interest rates, and exchange rates. Continued budget deficits will\nsteadily detract from the growth of the U.S. capital stock and may also trigger dislocating changes.\nAppendix: Derivation of the stability condition\nLet P denote the primary deficit (for either budget or trade), D the debt for either, and i the nation's\nnominal riskless interest rate.

         "Donald L Kohn: Monetary policy and imbalances\nSpeech by Mr Donald L Kohn, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System,\nat the Banking and Finance Lecture Series, Widener University, Chester, 1 April 2004.\n* * *\nInterest rates in the United States have been very low for some time. The Federal Reserve targets the\novernight federal funds rate, and for almost a year this rate has stood at 1 percent. By comparison, the\nfunds rate averaged more than 5 percent during the 1990s, and was last at 1 percent in the 1950s.\nSimilarly, the yield on a ten-year Treasury note now stands near 4 percent - a level not seen since\n1963 and more than 3 percentage points below the average of the past twenty years.\nThese low rates are no accident. The economy began to weaken in late 2000, and aggregate activity\nbegan to contract in early 2001. Starting in January of 2001, the Federal Reserve moved to counter\nthis weakness by lowering the funds rate to its present level in a series of steps that ended last June.\nThis prompt and aggressive action undoubtedly served to limit the decline in economic activity, and, in\nfact, the recent recession was one of the mildest on record.\nThe Federal Reserve recognizes that the federal funds rate is currently lower than it can be on a\nsustainable basis: At some point, as the economy moves back toward higher levels of employment,\npolicy accommodation will no longer be needed and the funds rate will be raised. But it does not\nappear that we are as yet at that point. The Federal Reserve has opted to keep its policy rate quite low\nand has said it can be patient in removing the degree of accommodation. Although the economy has\nindeed strengthened over the past few quarters, job growth has been anemic and considerable slack\npersists in labor markets. At the same time, inflation has been quite low and shows few signs that it is\nin the process of picking up.\nRecently, some observers have been calling for the Federal Reserve to begin the tightening process\nsooner rather than later. In a few cases, the reasoning appears to be that we are risking a major\nincrease in inflation by waiting. But most of the calls for a prompt policy tightening are instead based\non the concern that the Federal Reserve, by keeping the funds rate so low and signaling that it is likely\nto stay low for a while, is sowing the seeds for different kinds of future problems. In particular, these\ncritics worry that a continued environment of low interest rates is giving rise to economic imbalances -\nexcessive indebtedness, and elevated prices of houses, equities, and bonds - that in the longer run\nwill come back to haunt us.\nThey fear that the return to more-normal levels of short-term interest rates might eventually be\naccompanied by an especially sharp upswing in bond and mortgage rates, a softening in the prices of\nhouses and equities, and problems for households in meeting higher debt obligations that, in turn,\ncould result in a substantial weakening in spending.\nThose worried about these possibilities say that the Federal Reserve should begin to remove its policy\naccommodation promptly to limit any further buildup of debt and distortions of asset prices. Most of\nthese analysts acknowledge that such an action will entail some short-run pain - a slower recovery and\na weaker rebound in labor markets. But they see this near-term loss as more then compensated for by\nthe long-run gain of avoiding severe problems in the more distant future.\nToday I would like to examine this line of reasoning. The issue may seem abstract and arcane to an\naudience of non-economists - inside baseball as played in the financial markets and in the Board\nRoom of the Federal Reserve. But the approach taken to this policy question could have serious\nconsequences for the U.S. economy, and it illustrates nicely the types of subtle but fascinating issues\npolicymakers must confront. I must emphasize that these are my own views and not necessarily those\nof my colleagues at the Federal Reserve.\nThe effects of low interest rates\nAs I have already discussed, the current level of the federal funds rate came about in response to a\nweakening economy in 2001 and a recovery that has been characterized by the persistence of\nconsiderable slack in labor markets and low and declining inflation.\nStimulative monetary policy helps the economy recover from a spell of economic weakness largely\nthrough its effects on interest rates and asset prices. Long-term interest rates - the ones most relevant\nto the borrowing and spending decisions of households and firms - have been held down by easy\nmonetary policy and the expectation that short-term rates will remain low for some time. And these low\nrates in turn have boosted the prices of houses and the value of corporate equity. Under the influence\nof increased wealth and low borrowing costs, households have bought more and larger houses and\ncars, have taken on more debt, and generally have spent more than would have been the case if\ninterest rates had been higher. On the business side, low rates have helped firms reduce debt\nservicing and rebuild financial resilience by issuing long-term debt and paying off short-term debt,\nsetting the stage for a step-up in investment. Stronger balance sheets and higher profits have induced\ninvestors to reduce the risk premiums they require to lend to businesses, which has further supported\nbusiness spending.\nNothing is necessarily wrong with these developments; in fact, they are by-and-large the intended and\nlogical consequences of the Federal Reserve's efforts to reduce economic slack through low interest\nrates. To be sure, when short-term interest rates rise, bond yields will also rise, the amount of income\nneeded to service debt will increase, and the prices of houses and equity will begin to reflect the\ngreater competition for savers' dollars.\nBut as long as interest rates and asset prices are reasonably well aligned with the forces likely to\naffect the economy, and as long as the public has reasonably accurate expectations about the size\nand timing of the eventual increase in interest rates and its effect on wealth and debt service, then the\neconomy should not experience any particularly severe bumps when these developments unfold.\nUnder these circumstances, households and firms, in the aggregate, should not end up looking back\non their borrowing and spending actions as a mistake. If they do not view them as a mistake, they are\nunlikely to make major revisions in spending plans or asset valuations, and the effects on financial\nmarkets and the economy should be limited.\nOf course, expectations cannot be entirely accurate; the path interest rates will follow depends on\nfuture economic developments, many of which inevitably will be surprises, and in response markets\nwill need to adjust, perhaps substantially. Moreover, some households and firms probably harbor\nunrealistic expectations about the future based on extrapolations of recent interest rates or trends in\nasset prices, and they run the risk of experiencing serious difficulties as a result. But as long as\nmyopia appeared to be restricted to a relatively small portion of the population, and asset prices and\nexpectations in the aggregate seemed realistic given what we know today, we would have little reason\nto anticipate serious problems as interest rates adjust. However, if imbalances were thought to exist -\nif expectations appeared unrealistic and asset prices distorted - then we would judge that the potential\nfor a sharp correction in financial markets and associated economic instability was greater.\nIs there evidence that imbalances are emerging?\nDetermining whether such imbalances are present is a difficult task, and assessing whether those\nimbalances are related to current policy is even more challenging. But given their potential\nconsequences for the economy, these are issues that policymakers cannot ignore.\nLet me begin with the question of whether interest rates and asset prices have been pushed away\nfrom appropriate levels. Some observers worry that recent Federal Reserve policy, by keeping\nshort-term rates at very low levels for an extended period, has encouraged investors to \"reach for\nyield\" - that is, to shift their portfolios toward riskier and longer-term securities, which generally have\nhigher yields, to keep realized returns from falling. They also worry about the effects of a related\nbehavior in which financial intermediaries borrow at low short-term rates to lend at higher long-term\nrates - the so-called \"carry trade\" - and about the effects of low interest rates on the prices of houses.\nTo a considerable extent, these processes are part of the efficient functioning of markets: Investors\nshould compare the return they would receive on holding short-term deposits or the cost of borrowing\nshort-term to the potential returns on riskier assets and make investment decisions on the basis of the\ntrade-off between return and risk. Indeed, behaviors of this sort transmit accommodative monetary\npolicy through financial markets to accomplish its intended effect of stimulating demand. The issue is\nwhether this process has gone too far - that is, whether investors are failing to take adequate account\nof the risks of those alternative investments. Forming such a judgment requires a view on the level of\nasset prices that would be \"appropriate\" given economic fundamentals. Unfortunately, economists are\nnot very good at this, but neither is anyone else, including Wall Street analysts.\nThe Treasury securities market has been one focus of some concern. Some observers argue that, in\npart because of the carry trade and similar sorts of strategies, rates on intermediate- and longer-term\nTreasury securities are too low. An important observation, however, is that the yield curve is currently\nquite steep, implying that market participants have priced in a substantial rise in short-term rates.\nIndeed, the current shape of the yield curve suggests that investors expect short-term rates will\neventually be in the neighborhood of 4 to 5 percent. This expected rate is not unusually low by\nhistorical standards; it is near or even above the expectations during the low-inflation period of the\n1950s and early 1960s, and it is well within the range of expectations since the mid-1990s. The yield\ncurve implies a fairly gradual transition to those long-run levels, and some could argue that this implied\nadjustment is too gradual. However, this pattern in part reflects the Federal Reserve's statements\nabout policy patience and the fact that the economic expansion so far has made only limited progress\nin reducing slack, particularly in the labor market, even at very low interest rates. Overall, the question\nof whether the yield curve is steep enough is difficult to answer. Some analysis suggests that Treasury\nyields should be a bit higher, and we cannot rule out the possibility that long-term rates will rise once\nlabor markets begin to strengthen convincingly. Nonetheless, it would be hard to argue with much\nconfidence that yields are substantially out of line with plausible configurations of fundamental\ninfluences.\nCorporate bonds have also been the subject of some concern - specifically, whether the risk spreads\non bonds issued by domestic corporations, which have narrowed dramatically, particularly for\nlower-rated issuers, are too low to offer adequate compensation for the probability of future defaults. It\nwould be surprising had we not seen a narrowing of credit spreads over this period. Corporate profits\nhave expanded quite briskly of late, and various measures of business financial difficulties have\ndeclined substantially. Moreover, the outlook for corporations appears favorable, considering that we\nare now in the early stages of what we hope will be an extended period of economic expansion. Many\nspreads remain above levels they reached through much of the 1990s, and while they may be thin,\nthey do not appear to be clearly unreasonable in the context of recent and expected developments.\nWarnings about a possible \"bubble\" in house prices have been sounded for a number of years now.\nAbout a year ago, I examined this issue in some detail and concluded that, while one could never be\nvery confident about such a judgment, house prices were not obviously too high and the housing stock\nwas not clearly too large.1 Since then, however, prices have climbed further, and by more than the rise\nin rents - a proxy for the return on houses. Consequently, the odds have risen that these prices could\nbe out of line with fundamentals. We still cannot be very confident about whether a significant\nmisalignment exists, however. Moreover, some factors, including increasing prosperity and wealth\nassociated in part with rapid gains in labor productivity and earning power, should help support house\nprices in the future and thereby reduce the risk of a sizable correction in which prices actually fall\nacross a large number of localities.\nFinally, concerns have been expressed about the level of debt in our economy, especially household\ndebt. Debt owed by households is high relative to their income, and so too are the payments required\nby that debt and by other regular obligations. But the vast majority of households are not encountering\nproblems meeting obligations, and they have protected themselves to a considerable extent against\nincreasing interest rates by borrowing for longer terms at fixed rates. As a consequence, debt\nservicing obligations will rise very gradually even if market interest rates increase rapidly. Moreover,\nany increase in rates would most probably occur in circumstances in which income and employment\nwere also rising briskly, and thus adding to the resources available to consumers. And, while debt has\nbeen increasing, assets on household balance sheets have been rising even more rapidly. Barring a\ncollapse in house or equity prices when interest rates rise, household net worth should remain\ncomfortably above the levels of a few years ago.\nThis has been a very fast and somewhat cursory tour through U.S. financial markets. But the main\npoint should be clear: Although one can never be certain, in my view, the odds are that any\nimbalances that have emerged in U.S. asset markets or in the level of borrowing by U.S. households\nand businesses are not so substantial that they will disrupt the economy when they begin to correct.\nTo be sure, the prices of assets and the level of debt seem to reflect expectations of a benign\neconomic environment - one in which policy will tighten only gradually, the economy will continue to\nstrengthen and inflation will remain low, and the demand for houses and equities will remain solid.\nAlthough these expectations could leave markets exposed to unfavorable news, they are not obviously\nunreasonable.\nIn the absence of any substantial distortions in asset prices and debt levels, households and\nbusinesses, on average, have not likely been engaging in misguided decisions that they, or the central\nbank, will come to regret. Nevertheless, as emphasized above, policymakers face a tremendous\namount of uncertainty regarding this judgment. Some borrowers and lenders will be caught by surprise\nwhen rates rise and will suffer losses; houses could be overvalued in some markets and subject to\ncorrection; and even small, largely predictable changes in interest rates and asset prices could interact\nin unexpected ways. And asset prices and interest rates that look roughly in line with fundamentals\ntoday, may not be tomorrow. Because they cannot rule out the chance that some asset prices might\ncorrect more than anticipated, policymakers must consider how the economy might withstand such a\ncorrection.\nCorrections in interest rates and asset values may have the most potential for disruption when they\nimpair the financial health of borrowers and lenders and thereby cause them to pull back even further\nthan might be warranted by the change in rates or prices. In that regard, we have some reason to be\noptimistic that the players are well positioned to absorb these adjustments.\nWe have already discussed the reasons for confidence that household borrowers will be able to meet\ntheir obligations. Lenders, too, appear well positioned to weather any such adjustments. Commercial\nbanks remain highly profitable and well capitalized, and other financial intermediaries show few signs\nof widespread problems. I am encouraged by the way our financial system came through the very\ndifficult circumstances of the last few years, including the plunge in equity values, the recession, the\nsubsequent period of slow growth, and the spike in credit problems. To be sure, pockets of difficulty\nemerged, and lenders became more cautious, but, for the most part, credit continued to flow, and\nproblems remained isolated, not systemic. Our increasingly sophisticated financial market was able to\neffectively distribute risk so that lenders were sufficiently diversified to survive some quite stressful\ndevelopments.\nIn addition, financial markets have important automatic-stabilizer properties. If investors sense that\nasset-price adjustments are undermining the expansion, interest rates will fall back because investors\nwill anticipate a lower trajectory for the federal funds rate. For its part, the Federal Reserve will adapt\nits monetary policy to unexpected developments in an effort to keep the economy on track toward high\nemployment and stable prices.\nImplications for the current policy setting\nThat brings me to what I see as the implications of this analysis for the Federal Reserve's current\nmonetary policy of keeping the federal funds rate low and being patient in removing policy\naccommodation. I hope that the discussion has cast some doubt on the argument that this policy is\ngenerating substantial imbalances in the economy. I am not disputing the argument that current policy\nhas contributed to higher asset prices, more household indebtedness, and strong activity in\ninterest-sensitive sectors such as housing. But I am questioning the apparently firm conclusion of\nsome that these developments represent distortions or imbalances that are likely to correct in an\nabrupt and harmful manner. At the very minimum, one cannot reach this conclusion with a great deal\nof confidence. The distortions in the markets I have reviewed do not appear all that large, given the\nstance of monetary policy, and should we experience much higher interest rates and softer asset\nprices our resilient markets and flexible economy probably could absorb such a shock.\nNonetheless, I cannot rule out the possibility that destabilizing imbalances are building. Should\npolicymakers adjust policy today to slow the growth of debt and limit potential overshooting in bond\nand housing markets? Such a policy would clearly have near-term costs: It would slow the expansion\nin demand, damp the creation of new jobs, and keep inflation lower than it otherwise would be. Those\ncosts could be significant, given that the economy is already operating with substantial slack and that\nany further decline in inflation would leave it at uncomfortably low levels. In my view, policymakers\nface a very high burden of proof when it comes to accepting fairly predictable short-term pain in the\nform of slower expansion in exchange for the possibility of gain over the longer run in the form of\nreduced risks of fluctuations in output, induced by sharp and unanticipated variations in interest rates\nand asset prices. Despite some signs that values are stretched in some markets, I do not believe this\nburden of proof has been met at this time.\nCan actions be taken to limit the longer-run risks without near-term policy adjustments? At least two\nconsiderations come to mind. For one, policymakers should continue to remind people that the federal\nfunds rate very probably will have to move up at some point, and that they should be prepared for that\nadjustment. Households with high debt loads need to take account of the fact that the interest\npayments on their floating-rate loans will increase, probably taking a higher portion of their spendable\nfunds. Those lending to such households also need to take into account the rise in rates when they\njudge credit worthiness. Households and those that lend to them also cannot count on large increases\nin house prices persisting. Rising rates are sure to cool the housing market, and possibly could cause\nprices to soften in some localities.\nInvestors, too, must be aware that short-term interest rates, and hence the opportunity cost of their\nlonger-term investments, will increase. Borrowing short and lending long is risky and not a sure-fire\nway to eternally high profits. Investors are unlikely to be able to exit from these bets before the market\nstarts to adjust; it is highly probable that many folks in similar circumstances will be trying to squeeze\nthrough the same door at the same time, in which case prices could adjust sharply.\nThe second consideration is that regulators of financial institutions should strive to ensure that these\ninstitutions have risk-management systems in place that help to assess and control vulnerability to\npotential adjustments in interest rates and asset prices. In doing so, supervisors reinforce market\ndiscipline. Banking supervisors at the Federal Reserve, for example, in the course of the ongoing\nexamination process, have been paying close attention to the sorts of vulnerabilities we have reviewed\nand have been discussing these risks with the commercial banks they oversee.\nConclusion\nInterest rates are at unsustainable levels, and monetary policy will need to tighten eventually if the\neconomy is to be kept on a path to high employment and price stability. My remarks today were not\nfocused on the medium-term macroeconomic outlook and its implications for policy. Instead, I\naddressed a different and difficult set of issues for policymakers - whether policy adjustment should be\nmade that might make the medium-term outlook less favorable but might at the same time lower the\nodds on longer-term economic instability stemming from possible imbalances in financial markets.\nThis issue has been the subject of considerable research and discussion in recent years, and I have\nnot had time to touch on all its aspects. In recent months some central banks have cited similar types\nof financial imbalances when they tightened policy. But the economies in which these central banks\noperate have been running at higher levels of resource utilization and have experienced faster\nincreases in some asset prices than has the United States. My conclusion is that for the United States\nat this time, the balance of costs and benefits does not favor policy action to address possible\nimbalances.\nIn the process, I hope that I have given you a sense of the difficult judgments facing a policymaker in\nan uncertain world and that you have also gotten a taste of the intellectual interest and excitement of\nworking through such issues. This exercise is very similar to many others you would find in the public\nsector, and so I also hope you keep these challenges and rewards in mind when considering your\ncareer path.",

         "Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Macroeconomic outlook and uncertainties\nRemarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal\nReserve System, at the Twelfth District Community Leaders Luncheon, Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco, San Francisco, 8 April 2004.\n* * *\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today to speak about the current state of the U.S. economy. As you\nknow, the economy appears to be engaged in a gradual process of recovery. As has often been the\ncase in previous recoveries, however, the pace and breadth of the expansion thus far have been\nuneven. In particular, production and aggregate income have increased strongly in the past few\nquarters, but the labor market has been surprisingly weak. The most recent data suggest that the labor\nmarket is improving gradually; but the question of whether this improvement is fundamental and\ndurable will take some time to answer. Although prices for some commodities have risen, underlying\nconsumer price inflation only now looks to be stabilizing at a low level after falling for some time. In the\nremainder of my time with you today, I will first sketch more fully some of the recent developments in\nthe economy and what I believe to be the most likely path forward. Then I will discuss two\nuncertainties regarding that outlook that have garnered attention lately - namely the possibility that the\nlabor market will continue to underperform and the possibility that financial stress in the household\nsector may cause the expansion to falter. As I will discuss in greater detail shortly, it seems to me that\nthe evidence suggests that while neither risk can be ruled out, nor is either likely to come about. That\nsaid, of the two, the greater concern for me is the future performance of the labor market. As always,\nthe views I will be expressing are my own and do not necessarily represent those of other members of\nthe Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\nRecent economic developments\nFor the most part, the past year has been one of continued recovery in the U.S. economy. After\naveraging just 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the first half of last year, the pace of real GDP growth\nsurged to more than 6 percent in the second half. For 2003 as a whole, the pace of growth was the\nfastest since 1999. As has been the case for some time, households in 2003 provided considerable\nimpetus to the economy. Supported importantly by last summer's tax cuts, low interest rates, and\nrising household wealth, consumer spending continued to trend up, while low mortgage rates have\nkept both home sales and new housing starts close to record highs.\nIn addition, the economic environment now seems more conducive to business investment. For much\nof the past three years, businesses were reluctant to invest in new capital equipment. At first, the\ndownturn in investment seemed to be a reaction to what in hindsight appears to have been a\nsubstantial overinvestment in high-tech equipment in the late 1990s. As business investment\nsubsequently lagged the improvement in household spending, however, a marked degree of caution\nseemed to settle on the business community. This caution - which appears to have had its roots in the\nuncertainty associated with terrorism, geopolitical risks, and a wave of corporate governance scandals\n- induced firms to focus on restructuring rather than expanding their operations, and it left them quite\nhesitant to increase their investment outlays.\nBy the middle of last year, however, firms were beginning to boost their capital spending. And, in the\nsecond half, real fixed investment rose more than 10 percent at an annual rate, the fastest two-quarter\nrate of increase since early 2000. To be sure, a sizable portion of the recent strength in investment\nhas been for high-tech equipment, and much of it probably reflects replacement of outdated machines\nrather than an expansion of existing production capacity. However, spending on other types of\nequipment now seems to be picking up as well, and the caution that had previously restrained capital\nspending seems to be in the process of lifting.\nAgainst this backdrop, inflation has remained quite low despite some sizable increases in energy\nprices. Overall, the consumer price index increased 1.7 percent over the twelve months ending in\nFebruary, while the core index - which excludes the volatile food and energy components - increased\nonly a little more than 1 percent.\nOutlook and labor market uncertainties\nThe consensus in the forecasting community is that GDP growth will not continue at the 6 percent\npace posted in the second half of last year. But, with interest rates still quite low and fiscal policy\ngenerally stimulative, most forecasters are projecting relatively robust gains in output for the coming\nyear, with ongoing increases in both household and business spending.\nContinued strong economic expansion seems to me, as well, to be the most likely outcome.\nNonetheless, the economic outlook still bears some important uncertainties, two of which I would like\nto focus on today. The first relates to the labor market. As has been widely recognized, one notable\nshortcoming of the current expansion has been the dearth of job creation over the past two years. Last\nweek's report that employers added 308,000 workers to their payrolls in March was encouraging and\nmay signal that the recovery in the labor market is gaining traction. Even so, the level of private\nemployment remains more than 500,000 - or 1/2 percent - below that at the trough of the recession in\nNovember 2001. The weak performance of the labor market over this period has been quite unusual\nby the standards of past economic recoveries, and, indeed, it is even weaker than during the infamous\n\"jobless recovery\" of the early 1990s. For example, employment rose about 2 percent in the\ntwenty-eight months following the 1990-91 recession. And, in the other seven post-World War II\nrecoveries, employment growth averaged more than 8 percent over a period of comparable length.\nEconomic forecasters' consensus is that, as the expansion matures, employment will continue to\nimprove sufficiently to make noticeable gains in the utilization of labor resources. I judge that to be a\nreasonable assessment. Nonetheless, one cannot definitively rule out the possibility that hiring will fall\nshort of expectations over the next several months as it had up until the most recent report. In\nparticular, the lackluster performance we have seen in the labor market, even as real GDP has been\nmoving up strongly, raises the question of whether an unusually large portion of the job cuts\nimplemented by firms in recent years represent permanent layoffs that will only gradually be offset by\njob creation elsewhere in the economy.\nA number of hypotheses have been put forth as potential causes of the generally disappointing\nperformance of the labor market, and, indeed, it seems likely that several factors have contributed to\nthe shortfall in hiring. But any meaningful explanation must account for the surprising strength in\nproductivity growth in recent years. In particular, labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose\n4-1/4 percent in 2002 and nearly 5-1/2 percent in 2003, the largest back-to-back increases since the\nearly 1960s.\nLet me review the major hypotheses advanced to explain labor market developments. One possibility\nis that the same factors that induced businesses to take an unusually cautious approach to capital\nspending also influenced their willingness to add new workers. If so, then some of the surprising\nweakness in employment growth and some of the strength in productivity may have reflected a\ntendency by employers to stretch their existing work forces beyond a level that is sustainable in the\nlonger run. The sizable increase over the past year in employment at temporary help agencies -\nanother potential margin of adjustment for firms unwilling to take on permanent employees - is\nconsistent with this view. And, further supporting this hypothesis, one hears reports of longer hours\nworked by many white-collar and nonproduction workers.\nIf this hypothesis is correct, then the recent strength in business investment bodes well for an upturn in\nthe labor market if the pickup in capital spending is an indication that businesses have become more\noptimistic about the future course of the economy. Indeed, according to this hypothesis, the\nimprovement in hiring could be rapid as businesses respond not only to further increases in output but\nalso hire to alleviate the growing strains on their more experienced workers.\nThe chief argument against this story is that the combination of a weak labor market and strong\nproductivity growth has been ongoing for quite some time. And it certainly seems possible that a\nportion of the extraordinary productivity growth of recent years represents a permanent increase in\nefficiency. According to proponents of this view, some of these productivity improvements may have\nresulted from firms' focusing on restructuring and cost-cutting in ways that provide ongoing\nefficiencies. They may have been able to do so, in part, because they have realized a delayed\nefficiency payoff to the substantial investments in high-tech equipment in the late 1990s. Regardless of\nits source, however, the possibility that some of the productivity improvement - and some of the job\ncuts - of recent years are permanent suggests that the weak labor market may, in part, be associated\nwith an increase in the economy's potential output. This possibility implies that a given rate of increase\nin GDP may be consistent with a more gradual pickup in hiring than in the preceding scenario.\nFinally, a couple of other influences probably damped hiring somewhat but seem unlikely to have been\nmajor factors. For example, the recent sizable increases in health insurance costs and in pension\ncosts are cited by some as a reason for businesses to avoid hiring new employees. In the aggregate,\nhowever, health insurance costs represent only about 6 percent of overall compensation costs, and\nmany firms seem to have responded to these higher costs by reducing increases in either wages or\nother parts of the benefits package. Similarly, although a number of corporations have had to make\nsizable contributions to underfunded defined-benefit pension plans, the shrinking share of workers\ncovered by these plans suggests that such contributions probably have not had a material affect on\nhiring decisions. Moreover, during the second half of the 1990s, when pension plans were overfunded\nand, in many cases, improving the bottom lines of firms, one rarely, if ever, heard anecdotes\nsuggesting that low pension-funding costs were boosting employment.\nOther observers have pointed to the outsourcing of production abroad as a reason for the weakness in\nthe labor market. Again, however, the magnitude of this phenomenon seems too small to explain more\nthan a small part of the decline in employment over the past two years. Private-sector estimates of\noutsourcing are on the order of 1 percent of the gross job losses that occur each year. Moreover,\nbecause outsourcing abroad represents a shift of both production and labor input to a foreign country,\noutsourcing is probably not a major explanation for our recent history of elevated productivity growth.\nWhat does all of this imply for economic policy? In the short-term, the weakness in the labor market\nreflects a shortfall of aggregate demand relative to the economy's potential, which is an important part\nof the rationale for the currently accommodative stance of monetary policy. The real federal funds rate\nis now close to zero, and market participants expect it to remain near that level for a while. Obviously,\nwe monetary policy makers will have to determine the degree to which the improvements in the labor\nmarket signaled in the most recent report indicate that the economy is meaningfully closing the gap\nbetween aggregate demand and the economy's productive capability, and the pace with which that\ngap is being narrowed. As I said earlier, it will take some time to make that determination. But we also\nhave to recognize that maintaining the current level of the funds rate for too long will eventually result\nin an unwelcome increase in inflationary pressures.\nIn the longer run, it is important that we as a society recognize the considerable economic benefits\nassociated with sustainable increases in productivity and intensify our efforts to ensure that as many\nindividuals as possible profit from the substantial productivity gains associated with innovation and\nincreased competition. Unless we do so, the support of the population for flexible markets,\ntechnological change, and free and open trade - so crucial to the ongoing improvement of our\nstandard of living - will erode further.\nIn my view, the best long-run response to the inevitable turbulence of a dynamic market economy is to\nincrease our investment in the education and skills of the workforce. An improvement of this type\nwould pay handsome dividends in many respects - allowing not only workers who retain their jobs to\nbe more productive and earn higher wages but also allowing those who lose their jobs to gain\nreemployment in more stable jobs with less loss in earning power.\nWith experienced workers, society's challenge is to provide opportunities for those adversely affected\nby economic change to build on their previous work experience and to retool their skills to meet the\nchanging requirements of the economy. An important source of such opportunity has been our\ncommunity colleges, which have experienced sizable increases in enrollments since the early 1970s,\nparticularly among adults. In addition, many four-year public colleges and universities now offer\nprograms specifically tailored to the schedules of adults, many of whom are attempting to balance\npart-time schooling with family and work responsibilities. For our future workforce, we must ensure that\nour educational system is adequately equipping students with the greater skills demanded by\nemployers operating in an increasingly complex economy.\nI do not have the answers to these educational challenges. But I do know how important it is that we\naddress them. And given our successes in the past, I am confident that we can.\nFinancial health of households\nLet me now turn to a second important uncertainty in the outlook - namely, the financial health of U.S.\nhouseholds. As I mentioned earlier, a key element in the current cyclical expansion has been robust\nspending for consumption and housing. An oft-expressed concern has been that many households\nhave become overextended, will eventually have to cut back on spending, and in doing so may\nshort-circuit the expansion.\nIt is easy to see the basis for this concern. First, consider the rise in household debt. Relative to\ndisposable income, debt has been hitting record highs annually since 1993. Indeed, with house prices\nrising rapidly and interest rates at historically low levels, mortgage borrowing surged 12-1/2 percent in\neach of the past two years, twice the rate of growth of disposable income. Meanwhile, the personal\nbankruptcy rate, although relatively stable in recent quarters, is still near its record high.\nDespite these ominous sounding numbers, and while remaining alert to the possibility of more acute\nfinancial distress, I believe that, in the aggregate, households fundamentally are in good financial\nshape. Even with the heavy borrowing they have undertaken, households have kept their\ndebt-payment burdens in check. At the aggregate level, one can evaluate debt burdens in two ways.\nOne measure is the debt service ratio. The numerator of this ratio is the minimum payment required on\nmortgage and consumer debt - for example, car loans, student loans, and credit card debt - and the\ndenominator is after-tax income. The debt service ratio captures such things as the effects of changes\nin interest rates, loan maturities, and loan demand on the debt obligations of households.\nA somewhat broader measure - and one that the Federal Reserve has only recently introduced - is the\nfinancial obligations ratio. This measure adds required payments on rent, auto leases, homeowners'\ninsurance, and property taxes to debt service. This broader measure recognizes that both\nhomeowners and renters have fixed financial obligations, and it recognizes that there is no essential\ndifference between payments for an auto loan and those for an auto lease. Moreover, unlike the\nsimple ratio of debt to income, both the debt service ratio and the financial obligations ratio have\nreceded slightly, on net, from their respective peaks. Similarly, delinquency rates for a wide range of\nhousehold loans turned down over the second half of 2003.\nThose who are most concerned about the macroeconomic consequences of household debt argue\nthat although these measures of financial stress have stopped getting worse, they still are at very high\nlevels by historical standards; the risk, they argue, is that the household sector could be quite\nvulnerable to an adverse shock. This is a legitimate argument, but other factors limit my concern about\nthis possibility. First, most debt is held by households that also have substantial assets. Indeed,\naccording to the 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances, 96 percent of total debt is owned by households\nwith positive net worth - that is, assets greater than their liabilities. Moreover, looking at the question\nfrom the perspective of the number of households, fully 90 percent of all households in 2001 had\nassets greater than their liabilities.\nEven if one disaggregates these numbers further and focuses on the amount of debt held by\nlower-income households or by households particularly vulnerable to an adverse shock, the numbers\nare relatively small. For example, households in the lowest fifth of the income distribution hold only\n3 percent of all household debt. Widening the scope to the entire lower half of the income distribution,\nthese households have only about 20 percent of outstanding debt. In other words, 80 percent of debt\nis held by households in the upper half of the income distribution, and these are households that also\nhold substantial assets.\nReflecting these debt patterns, the bulk of the available statistical evidence suggests that adverse\nmovements in broad indicators of household financial health do not have much incremental predictive\npower for overall consumer spending. In essence, the research says that - after taking account of\ncurrent and expected income, wealth, and interest rates - debt burdens, delinquency rates, and the\nlike do not provide significant additional value in explaining movements in consumer spending.\nSome commentators have argued that the real fragility in the system will be exposed when interest\nrates return to more-normal levels. According to this argument, higher rates will boost required\nmonthly payments, which in turn will lead to a jump in loan defaults, severe strains on financial\ninstitutions, and a sharp cutback in household spending.\nIt is important to recognize, however, that an increase in short-term interest rates does not\nautomatically increase household debt payments across the board. A rise in rates will indeed increase\nborrowing costs on new credit extensions. However, most outstanding debt will not be affected by\nchanges in the federal funds rate because the majority of mortgages carry a fixed rate, as do the bulk\nof other loans to consumers. Moreover, as short-term rates rise, households will take out smaller loans\nor take out loans with longer maturities. And households will trim their borrowing, preferring in some\ninstances to pay for purchases with cash instead of credit. The empirical evidence suggests that, in\nthe face of rising interest rates, households curb their use of debt enough to almost entirely offset the\nhigher average cost of debt, leaving debt burdens little changed.\nAnother factor that tempers my concern is that interest rates will rise from their current low level only\nwhen the economic expansion is on more solid footing. Thus, while households very likely will, at\nsome point in the future, face a higher cost of credit on new borrowing, they will also be undertaking\nthat new borrowing against a backdrop of greater job security and continued strong growth of incomes.\nThat said, if the increase in rates crimps spending more than anticipated, I can assure you that we will\nmove once again, as we have done consistently throughout this cyclical episode, to provide\nappropriate support to the economic expansion.\nClearly some households have become burdened with excessive debt and may face considerable\nfinancial stress should their income become disrupted. Indeed, in order to help households like these\nacquire the information they need to make good financial decisions for themselves and their families,\nthe Federal Reserve System in 2003 initiated a national campaign to raise the visibility and highlight\nthe importance of financial education. But financially overextended households represent a small\nfraction of the total economy, and at the macroeconomic level, financial distress in the household\nsector seems unlikely to cut off the expansion.\nConclusion\nOverall, the macroeconomic outlook for the United States is favorable. Over the past year, the\neconomy has made considerable progress: Aggregate income is growing rapidly, business investment\nhas begun to recover, the stock market has rebounded, and interest rates and inflation remain very\nlow. To be sure, there are uncertainties regarding the outlook. While my concern about the labor\nmarket is somewhat alleviated by the most recent data, it remains at the top of my list. Another\nimportant uncertainty is the possibility that an adverse shock will expose an underlying weakness in\nthe financial condition of households. But, I believe the economy most likely will steer clear of\nsubstantial damage from this source.",

         "Ben S Bernanke: What policymakers can learn from asset prices\nRemarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, before The Investment Analysts Society of Chicago, Chicago, 15 April 2004.\nThe references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.\n* * *\nCentral bankers naturally pay close attention to interest rates and asset prices, in large part because\nthese variables are the principal conduits through which monetary policy affects real activity and\ninflation. But policymakers watch financial markets carefully for another reason, which is that asset\nprices and yields are potentially valuable sources of timely information about economic and financial\nconditions. Because the future returns on most financial assets depend sensitively on economic\nconditions, asset prices - if determined in sufficiently liquid markets - should embody a great deal of\ninvestors' collective information and beliefs about the future course of the economy.\nI thought you might find it interesting to hear a bit about how the staff of the Federal Reserve uses\nfinancial-market information to try to improve forecasts and help guide policy decisions. As you will\nsee, asset prices provide information, particularly about market expectations, that is difficult to obtain\nelsewhere. However, a recurring theme of my remarks will be that extracting accurate information from\nasset prices and yields is more difficult and requires greater sophistication than is commonly\nsupposed. Ongoing research in financial economics thus has great potential to provide practical\nassistance to monetary policy makers.\nAs usual, the views I will express today are not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System.1\nMarket expectations of inflation: the information in inflation-indexed securities\nI will begin by discussing what financial markets can tell us about inflation expectations. The inflation\nexpectations of financial-market participants are of particular interest to central bankers, for several\nreasons. First, as price stability is a key objective of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve puts\nsubstantial resources into forecasting inflation. To the extent that financial markets serve to aggregate\nprivate-sector information about the likely future course of inflation, data on asset prices and yields\nmight be used to validate and perhaps improve the Fed's forecasts. Second, inflation expectations are\nof interest to policymakers independent of inflation itself. A considerable literature suggests that\nsuccessful monetary policies should stabilize, or \"anchor,\" inflation expectations so as to prevent them\nfrom becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, 1993; Evans and Honkapohja,\n2003). Finally, knowledge of the expectations of inflation in financial markets permits the calculation of\nreal interest rates, which are important indicators of both the condition of the economy and the stance\nof monetary policy.\nAlthough clues about inflation expectations abound in financial markets, inflation-indexed securities\nwould appear to be the most direct source of information about inflation expectations and real interest\nrates.2 Government securities whose realized yields depend on inflation, known on the Street as\n\"linkers,\" have become increasingly common in industrial countries, Japan being the latest nation to\nintroduce an inflation-indexed government bond. The U.S. Treasury began issuing TIIS (for Treasury\ninflation-indexed securities), more popularly known as TIPS (for Treasury inflation-protected\nsecurities), in January 1997. TIPS promise a yield-to-maturity that is guaranteed in real terms. To\nprovide the promised real yield, TIPS coupon and principal payments are escalated based on\nincreases in the consumer price index from the time at which the security was issued.\nThe difference between the real yield guaranteed by an inflation-linked security and the nominal yield\nprovided by a conventional security of the same maturity is known as the breakeven inflation rate or,\nalternatively, as inflation compensation. The top panel of Figure 1 shows the yield on nominal ten-year\nTreasury bonds (top line) and the real yield on ten-year TIPS since 1999 (bottom line). The vertical\ndistance between the two lines is known as breakeven inflation at the ten-year horizon. The bottom\npanel uses overlapping issues of nominal securities and TIPS to disaggregate breakeven inflation into\nthe rate that applies to bonds maturing five years from now and the implied forward breakeven rate\nfrom five to ten years out. The breakeven rate of inflation is often treated as a direct reading of\ninvestors' expectations of inflation. Under this interpretation, the lower line in the bottom panel of\nFigure 1 is an estimate of market inflation expectations over the next five years, and the upper line\nrepresents five-year forward expectations of inflation, that is, today's expectation of what average\ninflation will be between 2009 and 2014.\nUnfortunately, as a measure of market participants' expected inflation, breakeven inflation has a\nnumber of problems (Sack, 2000; Shen and Corning, 2001). First, and probably the most important,\nbreakeven inflation includes a return to investors for bearing inflation risk, implying that the breakeven\nrate likely overstates the market's expected rate of inflation. Estimates of the inflation risk premium for\nbonds maturing during the next five to ten years are surprisingly large, generally in a range between\n35 and 100 basis points, depending on the time period studied (Ang and Bekaert, 2003; Goto and\nTorous, 2003; Buraschi and Jiltsov, 2004). If the inflation risk premium averages 50 basis points, for\nexample, then breakeven inflation will overstate the market's true expectation of inflation by half a\npercentage point, a substantial amount. A further complication is that inflation risk premiums are not\nconstant but instead appear to vary over time as economic circumstances change.\nSecond, although the issuance of inflation-protected securities has risen significantly, the outstanding\nquantities of these securities remain much smaller than those of conventional Treasury securities.\nMoreover, TIPS are attractive to buy-and-hold investors, in contrast to nominal Treasury securities,\nwhich are extensively used for trading and hedging (Sack and Elsasser, 2004). For both reasons, the\nmarket for TIPS remains significantly less liquid than those for most Treasury securities. All else equal,\nthe likely presence of a liquidity premium in the TIPS return tends to make breakeven inflation an\nunderestimate of expected inflation, thus offsetting to some degree the effect of the inflation risk\npremium.3 Like inflation risk premiums, liquidity premiums on TIPS appear to vary over time, further\ncomplicating the interpretation of breakeven inflation.\nA third issue is that the real values of the coupon payments on an indexed security are fixed by\nconstruction, while the real coupons of a nominal bond usually decline over its life. Hence, an indexed\nsecurity typically has a longer duration with respect to real interest rate changes than does the nominal\nsecurity, a difference that affects the relative riskiness of real and nominal securities.4 More generally,\nbecause TIPS returns are imperfectly correlated with the yields on both nominal Treasuries and\nstocks, some investors demand TIPS for general diversification purposes - a demand that appears to\nhave increased significantly as investors have become more familiar with this new type of asset. As\nthe supply of TIPS has been fairly limited, the rise in demand by institutional investors and others may\npush down the equilibrium real return on TIPS and thus raise measures of breakeven inflation.5\nA separate issue that bears on the relevance of breakeven inflation for policymaking is that TIPS\nreturns depend on the overall consumer price index (CPI), whereas for many purposes policymakers\nare more interested in the behavior of core inflation, a measure of inflation that strips out volatile food\nand energy prices. In fact, TIPS returns appear sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices.\n3\nAs a partial fix of this problem, the breakeven inflation rates shown in Figure 1 are calculated by comparing the yields of\nTIPS and so-called off-the-run securities. Within a given class of securities, say Treasury bonds with ten years until maturity,\noff-the-run securities are securities other than those most recently issued. Because off-the-run securities are less liquid than\nnewly issued (on-the-run) securities, they provide a more appropriate benchmark against which to compare the yields of\nrelatively illiquid inflation-indexed bonds.\n4\nAs Sack (2000) has pointed out, this difference in duration implies that the breakeven inflation rate may be sensitive to the\nexpected profile of future short real rates or be affected by differences in risk premiums arising from different exposure to\ninterest-rate risk. Sack addressed the issue of differing durations of nominal securities and TIPS by comparing yields on\nTIPS to yields on artificial securities constructed to provide the same pattern of real payments as a TIPS security, thereby\neliminating the differences in duration noted in the text. He found, however, that the duration mismatch is less important\nquantitatively than differences in liquidity between on-the-run nominal securities and TIPS.\n5\nA number of technical issues, such as the lags in the inflation adjustment procedure, affect the relationship of breakeven\ninflation and expected inflation. One such potential complication arises if the tax rates applicable to the marginal TIPS\ninvestor and to the marginal holder of nominal government securities are not the same, in which case the equilibrium\nbreakeven inflation level will be affected. Roll (2004) discusses the effects of taxation on the breakeven inflation rate.\nBIS Review 21/2004\nAs you can see in Figure 1, breakeven inflation rates have proven surprisingly volatile over their short\nhistory. For example, when nominal Treasury yields swung sharply during the spring and summer of\n2003, ten-year breakeven inflation moved sharply as well, declining about 40 basis points as the bond\nmarket rallied, then rising about 80 basis points when nominal yields came back up (top panel). This\neffect was seen also in inflation compensation at the five-to-ten-year horizon (bottom panel), a rather\ncounterintuitive result.\nWhat should we make of the volatility of breakeven inflation over recent years? One interpretation is\nthat inflation expectations are not as well anchored as policymakers would like (see Bernanke, 2004,\nfor additional evidence on this point). The fact that inflation compensation tends to react strongly both\nto releases of macroeconomic data and to unexpected changes in monetary policy (Gurkaynak, Sack,\nand Swanson, 2003) supports this interpretation.\nStill, at this point I think we need to be cautious about drawing strong conclusions about the short-run\nbehavior of expected inflation from the data on breakeven inflation. The fact that the volatility of\nbreakeven inflation is so much greater than that of standard survey measures of inflation expectations\n(such as those collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia for professional forecasters or\nby the University of Michigan for consumers) should give us pause. The responsiveness of breakeven\ninflation to what might be construed primarily as liquidity disturbances, such as the Russian debt crisis\nand recent bouts of mortgage hedging activity that roiled Treasury markets, suggests that variable\nliquidity premiums, together with varying inflation risk premiums, contaminate breakeven inflation as a\nmeasure of expected inflation.6\nI have emphasized some reasons to be cautious in interpreting breakeven inflation as expected\ninflation. Nevertheless, I expect that the usefulness of inflation-indexed securities as a tool for\nmeasuring expected inflation will increase over time. The liquidity of TIPS should continue to improve\nas the share of government debt issued in inflation-linked form continues to rise, particularly if the\nTreasury decides to expand the range of maturities of indexed bonds that it offers. Moreover, as I will\ndiscuss briefly later in the talk, our ability to model risk and liquidity premiums is improving, which will\nhelp us control for an important source of volatility in breakeven inflation. Finally, the universe of\ninflation-linked financial assets seems to be increasing, which will allow for fruitful comparisons and\ncross-checking. For example, futures on the CPI were recently introduced on the Chicago Mercantile\nExchange. Although these contracts are not yet widely traded, they may at some point provide useful\nmeasures of breakeven inflation out to the maturity of the shortest-term TIPS, thereby filling in an\nimportant portion of the term structure of breakeven inflation.\nInterest rates and spreads as leading indicators\nAn alternative approach to extracting information from financial markets is to examine a range of asset\nprices and yields to determine whether they are useful as leading indicators of economic\ndevelopments. Financial prices meet several key criteria for being useful leading indicators. As I\nalready noted, asset prices and yields are inherently forward looking and thus may contain information\nabout future economic conditions not evident in other series. Moreover, asset prices, unlike many data\nseries, are available on a timely and continuous basis and are not revised. At least since the 1930s,\nwhen Wesley Mitchell and Arthur Burns (1938) published their pioneering work, economists have\nnoted the usefulness of asset prices in forecasting economic activity - though perhaps we should keep\nin mind Paul Samuelson's wry observation that \"the stock market has predicted nine of the last five\nrecessions.\"\nAlthough many financial quantities have been used in forecasting (an index of stock prices is included\nin the official index of leading indicators), interest rates on various financial instruments have perhaps\nbeen most often cited for their value as leading indicators.7 For example, in a 1992 paper, Alan Blinder\nand I found evidence that the federal funds rate, the short-term interest rate used by the Federal\nReserve as its policy instrument, has significant predictive power for a variety of measures of\neconomic activity.\nVarious yield spreads have also been found to be informative about the future course of the economy.\nIn 1989, James Stock and Mark Watson proposed a new index of leading indicators based on seven\nvariables with exceptionally good forecasting track records up to that date. Among these variables\nwere the spread between the ten-year and one-year Treasury yields (the term spread), the yield\ndifferential between commercial paper and Treasury bills (the public-private spread), the change in the\nten-year Treasury yields, and the nominal exchange rate.8 Thus, Stock and Watson found that two of\nthe best seven macroeconomic forecasting variables were interest rate spreads, and four of the best\nseven forecasters were financial in nature.\nOf these variables, the term spread (also known as the slope of the yield curve) had been recognized\nfor some time as a useful indicator of cyclical conditions. Figure 2 shows the historical behavior of the\nterm spread (top panel, here measured as the ten-year rate less the three-month rate), as well as that\nof the federal funds rate and the spread between commercial paper and three-month T-bill yields for\ncomparison. The shaded areas indicate periods of recession as designated by the National Bureau of\nEconomic Research. It is interesting that the slope of the Treasury yield curve has turned negative (top\npanel), at least briefly, at between two and six quarters before every U.S. recession since 1964 (Ang,\nPiazzesi, and Wei, 2003). It has given only one false signal, in 1966, when an economic slowdown\n- but not an official recession - followed the inversion of the yield curve. The slope of the yield curve is\npotentially informative for several reasons. To some extent, it captures the stance of monetary policy.\nFor example, when the yield curve is sharply upward sloping, as is the case today, one can usually\nconclude that monetary policy is in an expansionary mode (because the short-term policy rate lies\nbelow the average of expected future short-term rates). Either an expected pickup in economic growth\nor higher expected future inflation would also tend to raise long-term rates relative to short rates,\nsteepening the yield curve. Evidence for the predictive power of the slope of the yield curve has been\nfound for other industrialized countries as well as for the United States.9\nAlthough the evident information content of the term spread and other yields and spreads is intriguing,\nthese variables - like breakeven inflation - hardly provide a foolproof forecasting tool. For example, the\nStock-Watson indicator and other indicators based on interest rates and spreads signaled the 1990-91\nrecession very weakly and rather late. The yield curve was inverted from June 2000 through March\n2001, which presaged the 2001 recession, but other financial indicators (such as the public-private\nspread) missed the downturn entirely (Stock and Watson, 2003a), as you can see in Figure 2. More\ngenerally, Stock and Watson (2003b) have recently documented that simple forecasting relationships\nare typically quite unstable, presumably because both the nation's economic structure, the conduct of\npolicy, and the mix of shocks that buffet the economy change over time.\nAlthough the use of financial data as leading indicators is not without risks, I suspect that economists\nwill continue to try to find better ways to extract the information in these data. I see two general\napproaches as being especially promising. First, forecasting relationships that simultaneously use\ninformation from a large number of data series may be more robust than prediction equations based\non only a few variables (Stock and Watson, 2003b). One effective way to summarize the information in\nlarge data sets is through the estimation of statistical models that extract the common information\nconveyed by many variables.10 Currently, the U.S. Treasury uses a model of this type in preparing its\nforecasts of gross domestic product (GDP), and the Chicago Fed's national activity index, which draws\non earlier work by Stock and Watson, is also based on these methods. The Board staff is currently\ninvestigating the potential of this approach for forecasting the economy.\nThe other promising approach is to combine financial and macroeconomic information in a more\nstructured way. For example, Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei (2003) have used modern financial theory to\nconstruct a model of the Treasury yield curve that closely links the behavior of real GDP and a few key\ninterest rates. In particular, their framework incorporates the possibility of two-way causality, allowing\nfor both interest-rate effects on the economy and the impact of economic developments on interest\nrates. These authors show that combining financial and macroeconomic elements in a single model\npermits better forecasts of both GDP and of interest rates than can be achieved through less formal\nmethods.11 Other work, for example by Ang and Bekaert (2003), shows how modeling the links\nbetween interest rates and the economy may help us obtain more efficient forecasts of inflation. These\nmethods are also being studied at the Federal Reserve Board.\nOne important advantage of this theory-based modeling approach is that it permits the estimation of\nrisk premiums. For example, presumably the predictive power of the term spread would be enhanced\nif we could separate changes in the spread resulting from changes in rate expectations from those\narising from changes in risk premiums. Similarly, better estimates of inflation risk premiums would\nprove useful for adjusting breakeven inflation rates from TIPS to get more reliable measures of\nexpected inflation.\nMarket expectations of monetary policy\nWhat do markets expect about the future course of monetary policy? The question is important to\npolicymakers, not because we are concerned necessarily that we should meet the market's\nexpectations - such a strategy quickly degenerates into a hall of mirrors - but as a check on the\nefficacy of our communication. If the policy expectations of the market differ significantly from the\npolicy expectations of central bankers, then the two leading possibilities are, first, that the policy\ncommittee has not accurately communicated its outlook and objectives or, second, that the market\nhears the policy committee's message but is skeptical of it.\nA number of financial instruments provide readings on the market's policy expectations. Two of the\nmost useful are federal funds futures contracts and eurodollar futures contracts. These contracts are\ntraded in highly liquid markets.12 Moreover, by their nature they are closely tied to expectations of\nmonetary policy changes, as both reflect rates paid in the interbank market, the market that is targeted\nby the Federal Reserve's open-market operations.13\nImplied forward values of short-term interest rates at various horizons can be extracted from federal\nfunds and eurodollar futures contract prices in a straightforward way. Figure 3 provides an illustration.\nThe lower, dashed line shows the path of the expected federal funds rate through 2008 as implied by\nfederal funds and eurodollar futures at the close of the market on April 1, 2004, with an adjustment for\nthe average level of term premiums. The upper, solid line shows the path of expected funds rates as of\nthe market close on the next day, April 2. As you probably know, the payroll employment numbers\nannounced on April 2 significantly exceeded market expectations. Figure 3 shows that the payroll data\nseems to have caused the market to price in an expectation of a higher federal funds rate target over\nthe entire policy horizon. Of course, that change in policy expectations is consistent with the significant\nrise in Treasury yields that occurred after the employment report.\nObserving market expectations of policy provides useful feedback to the policymakers. Yet again,\nhowever, caution is needed in interpreting these data. As with inflation-indexed securities, forward\ninterest rates implied by futures contracts do not necessarily correspond to market expectations of the\nshort-term rate, because of the presence of premiums for interest-rate risk.14 Indeed, research\nsuggests that risk premiums in federal funds and eurodollar futures contracts are not trivial and may\nvary over time. For example, a study by Piazzesi and Swanson (2004) has found that risk premiums\non federal funds futures are both strongly countercyclical and predictable at longer horizons. The\nimplication is that, although futures prices provide good estimates of market expectations of policy at\nshort horizons of six months or so, at longer horizons they can be misleading. In particular, Piazzesi\nand Swanson (2004) find that if analysts ignore risk premiums in federal funds and eurodollar futures,\nthey will estimate longer-horizon policy expectations that \"lag behind\" actual market expectations,\nremaining too high when the Fed is easing and too low when the Fed is tightening.15 Fortunately, this\nresearch also shows how to correct the futures data to account for the time variation in risk premiums.\nOnce again, we see that some subtlety is required to extract the information available in asset prices.\nA great advantage of market-based measures of policy expectations, relative to periodic surveys that\nask market participants about their expectations, is that market measures are available essentially\ncontinuously.16 These measures thus lend themselves to \"event studies\" of two types, both of which\nare employed at the Board of Governors. The first type analyzes how various events, such as Federal\nReserve statements; the release of minutes, testimony, or speeches by members of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC); and macroeconomic news affect market expectations of monetary policy.\nOne simply compares the implied policy expectations before and after the event being studied. We\nhave already considered an example, the effects of the most recent payroll report, in Figure 3.\nAnalyses of this type provide insights for policymakers into the question of what economic factors the\n\"market,\" viewed collectively, is focusing on at a given time.\nThe second type of event study uses market-based measures of policy expectations to analyze the\neffects of policy changes on the economy. In particular, when the FOMC chooses to set the target for\nthe federal funds rate at a value different from that expected by the market, asset prices tend to react\nstrongly. For example, in a recent paper, Kenneth Kuttner and I (2004) studied the effects on stock\nprices of unanticipated changes in monetary policy, as measured by settings of the federal funds rate\ntarget that differ from those implied by federal funds futures market. We found that a surprise increase\nof 25 basis points in the funds rate target typically results in a decline in broad equity indexes of about\n1 percent, whereas a change in the funds rate that is expected by the market has essentially no effect\non stock prices.17 Our work is just one example of a number of event-study analyses that may well\nshed light on the effects of monetary policy and the channels of monetary policy transmission.\nPolicymakers are concerned not only about market expectations of output, inflation, interest rates, and\nother key variables, but also about the extent of market uncertainty about those and other variables.\nFinancial data provide insight about market uncertainty that is obtainable nowhere else. For example,\nthe Board's staff regularly analyzes the prices of options on eurodollar futures to estimate the degree\nof uncertainty that market participants have about monetary policy at different horizons. Indeed, by\nexamining options with different strike prices, and under some reasonable additional assumptions, one\ncan produce a full probability distribution of market expectations for the level of the federal funds rate\nat various dates in the future. Likewise, analysis of various types of options can generate distributions\nof expectations for economic and financial variables ranging from oil prices to the exchange value of\nthe dollar to future stock prices.18\nConclusion\nFinancial markets aggregate enormous amounts of information and thus provide a rich hunting ground\nfor central bankers trying to learn about the economy. Today I have tried to provide a small taste of the\nmany types of financial data that are analyzed by the staff at the Federal Reserve as well as to give\nyou some sense of the techniques that they bring to bear. A message that I also hope to leave with\nyou is that some of the potentially most valuable information in financial markets often requires\nconsiderable theoretical and empirical sophistication to extract. For this reason, and as I mentioned at\nthe beginning, financial research of the type being conducted at the Board, in academia, and in the\ninvestment community will prove invaluable to the Federal Reserve in our efforts to support a stronger\nand more stable economy.\nBIS Review 21/2004\nBIS Review 21/2004\nBIS Review 21/2004",

         "Alan Greenspan: Capitalising reputation\nRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the 2004 Financial Markets Conference of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Sea\nIsland, Georgia, (via satellite), 16 April 2004.\n* * *\nRecent transgressions in financial markets have underscored the fact that one can hardly overstate\nthe importance of reputation in a market economy. To be sure, a market economy requires a structure\nof formal rules - for example, a law of contracts, bankruptcy statutes, a code of shareholder rights. But\nrules cannot substitute for character. In virtually all transactions, whether with customers or with\ncolleagues, we rely on the word of those with whom we do business. If we could not do so, goods and\nservices could not be exchanged efficiently. The trillions of dollars of assets that are priced and traded\ndaily in our financial markets before legal confirmation illustrate the critical role of trust. Even when\nfollowed to the letter, rules guide only a few of the day-to-day decisions required of business and\nfinancial managers. The rest are governed by whatever personal code of values that managers bring\nto the table.\nMarket transactions are inhibited if we cannot trust the reliability of counterparties' information. The\nability to rely on the word of a stranger is integral to any sophisticated economy. A reputation for\nhonest dealings within a business or financial corporation is critical for effective corporate governance.\nEven more important is the way outsiders view the corporation itself. The reputation of a corporation is\nan exceptionally important market value that in principle is capitalized on a balance sheet as goodwill.\nReputation and trust were valued assets in freewheeling nineteenth-century America. Throughout\nmuch of that century, laissez-faire reigned, and caveat emptor was the prevailing prescription for\nguarding against wide-open trading practices. A reputation for honest dealing was thus particularly\nvalued. Even those inclined to be less than scrupulous in their private dealings had to adhere to a\nmore ethical standard in their market transactions, or they risked being driven out of business.\nTo be sure, the history of business is strewn with Fisks, Goulds, and numerous others treading on, or\nover, the edge of legality. But they were a distinct minority. If the situation had been otherwise, the\nUnited States at the end of the nineteenth century would never have been poised to displace Great\nBritain as the world's leading economy.\nReputation was especially important to early U.S. bankers. It is not by chance that many bankers in\nthe nineteenth century could effectively issue non-interest-bearing liabilities in the form of currency.\nThey worked hard to develop and maintain a reputation that their word was their bond. For these\ninstitutions to succeed and prosper, people had to trust their promise to redeem banknotes in specie.\nThe notion that \"wildcat banking\" was rampant before the Civil War is an exaggeration. Certainly,\ncrooks existed in banking as in every business. Some banks that issued currency made redemption\ninconvenient, if not impossible. But these banks were fly-by-night operators and rarely endured\nbeyond the first swindle.\nIn fact, most bankers, especially on Wall Street, competed vigorously for reputation. Those who had a\nhistory of redeeming their banknotes in specie, at par, were able to issue substantial quantities,\neffectively financing their balance sheets with zero-interest debt. J.P. Morgan marshaled immense\npower on Wall Street in large part because of his widespread reputation for fulfilling his promises.\nOver the past half century, the American public has embraced the protections of the myriad federal\nagencies that have largely substituted government financial guarantees and implied certifications of\nintegrity for business reputation. As a consequence, the market value of trust so prominent in the\nnineteenth century seemed unnecessary and by the 1990s appeared to have faded to a fraction of its\nearlier level.\nPresumably, we are better protected and, accordingly, better off as a consequence of these\ngovernmental protections. But corporate scandals of recent years have clearly shown that the plethora\nof laws of the past century have not eliminated the less-savory side of human behavior.\nWe should not be surprised then to see a re-emergence of the market value placed on trust and\npersonal reputation in business practice. After the revelations of corporate malfeasance, the market\npunished the stock prices of those corporations whose behaviors had cast doubt on the reliability of\ntheir reputations. Recent allegations on Wall Street of breaches of trust or even legality, if true, could\nbegin to undermine the very basis on which the world's greatest financial markets thrive. Guilty parties\nshould be expeditiously punished. Some practices and rules have outlived their usefulness and\nrequire updating. But in so doing we need to be careful not to undermine the paradigm that has so\neffectively governed voluntary trade. Rewriting rules that have served us well is fraught with the\npossibility for collateral damage.\nI hope and anticipate that trust and integrity again will be amply rewarded in the marketplace as they\nwere in earlier generations. There is no better antidote for the business and financial transgressions of\nrecent years.",

         "Alan Greenspan: The state of the banking industry\nStatement of Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, US Senate, Washington,\n20 April 2004.\n* * *\nChairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, and members of the committee, I am pleased to be here this\nmorning to discuss the condition of the U.S. banking system and various related matters. They include\nimproved risk-management practices of banks, the current status and direction of our regulatory efforts\nto revise capital standards for internationally active banks, deposit insurance, and the ongoing\nconsolidation process within our domestic banking industry.\nGrowth in the size and complexity of the largest U.S. and foreign banking organizations, in particular,\nhas substantially affected financial markets and the supervisory and regulatory practices of the\nFederal Reserve and other bank regulatory agencies around the world. It has, in part, required\nauthorities to focus more than before on the internal processes and controls of these institutions and\non their ability to manage risk. Only through steady and continued progress in measuring and\nunderstanding risk will our banking institutions remain vibrant, healthy, and competitive in meeting the\ngrowing financial demands of the nation while keeping systemic risk at acceptable levels. Therefore,\nthe regulatory authorities must provide the industry with proper incentives to invest in\nrisk-management systems that are necessary to compete successfully in an increasingly competitive\nand efficient global market.\nWhen I last discussed the condition of the banking industry with this committee in June 2001, the\nindustry's asset quality had begun to decline, but from a relatively high level, and banks were generally\nwell positioned to deal with the emerging problems. Moreover, as early as the late 1990s, both the\nindustry and bank supervisors had begun to address the slippage in credit standards that was one of\nthe causes of the drop in asset quality. By most measures, this was an unusually early stage in the\neconomic cycle to begin addressing such deterioration.\nToday, with the benefit of hindsight, we can see that the weaknesses I cited then have indeed been\nmild for the banking system as a whole and that the system remains strong and well positioned to\nmeet customer needs for credit and other financial services. During the past two years, in particular,\nthe industry extended its string of high and often record quarterly earnings. For the full year 2003,\ncommercial banks reported net profits of more than $100 billion while maintaining historically high\nequity and risk-based capital ratios and enjoying brisk asset growth. Although the demand for\nbusiness loans and the underwriting of equity securities have been weak over the past few years,\nbanking organizations have continued to benefit from strong demand for household credit, not least for\nresidential mortgage products as interest rates declined substantially.\nMoreover, the volume of problem assets in commercial banks declined each quarter last year,\nincluding a drop in the fourth quarter of nearly 10 percent, which brought the ratio of problem assets to\ntotal loans and foreclosed assets to less than 1 percent - its lowest level since year-end 2000. As a\nresult of this favorable performance, both the size and the number of bank failures in recent years\nhave been exceptionally small. Last year, for example, only two banks, with combined assets of just\n$1.5 billion, failed.\nThe results of last year's interagency review of large syndicated loans and internal reports about the\nlevel and distribution of their criticized and classified credits lead us to expect still further improvement\nin the industry's asset quality this year. Notably, the pool of \"special mention\" credits that are weak but\nstill performing (and which tend to produce the more serious problem assets) has shrunk both in the\nannual Shared National Credit review and in the quarterly bank reports.\nRisk measures derived from prices of publicly traded bank securities - stocks, debt securities, and\ncredit default swaps - also signal that market participants are taking an increasingly positive view of\nthe future of banks. Indeed, these measures suggest the lowest level of market concern about these\ncompanies that we have seen during the five-years in which we have tracked them.\nThe banking industry's relatively benign experience with loan losses these past few years may not be\nsurprising given that the recession was mild by most measures. The experience is more notable,\nhowever, when one considers the broader range of shocks and developments that have occurred\nduring this period, including the September 11 attacks, Argentina's credit default, the continuing shift\nby large and not-so-large firms in this country from bank to capital market financing, and the\nconcentration of recent economic pressures on specific industries and business sectors. These events\ntended to reduce the overall quality of corporate loan portfolios at banks and contributed significantly\nto banks' efforts to improve their measurement and management of risks, especially after the\nsubstantial credit losses they suffered in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These efforts, aided by the\ncontinued trend toward industry consolidation, helped moderate previous concentrations of credit\nexposures in bank portfolios and fueled greater use of new methods of hedging and managing risk.\nAt present, credit risk-management practices are perhaps least developed in measuring risk\nassociated with exposures related to construction projects and to the financing of commercial real\nestate, which have grown rapidly, particularly among regional and community banks. At all banks,\nsuch lending represented nearly 19 percent of all bank loans at year-end 2003 - the highest level thus\nfar recorded - and accounted for essentially all the loan growth last year at banks with less than\n$1 billion in assets.\nDespite the limited development of formal risk-management practices, credit standards applied to\nthese loans have apparently been quite high. At least, we see as yet no signs of rising credit losses\nfrom such lending, and supervisory and market sources indicate that the poor lending practices of the\nlate 1980s and early 1990s have been largely avoided. Nonetheless, the historical record provides\nample evidence of the risks associated with this form of lending and of accumulating large credit\nconcentrations in any form of exposure. Supervisors continue to monitor these concentrations and the\nlending practices and market conditions that will ultimately determine their effects on the banking\nsystem.\nThese and other gradual changes in the balance sheets of banks, along with the sustained decline in\nmarket rates, helped compress net interest margins at many banks, as they chose not to reflect the full\neffect of lower market rates into rates paid on deposits without a specified maturity. As a percentage of\nearning assets, net interest income of all insured commercial banks declined 27 basis points last year,\nto 3.80 percent, the lowest level in more than a decade. Although this compression eased slightly\nduring the fourth quarter, we cannot yet tell whether margins have begun to rebound.\nThis compression of margins needs to be understood in the fuller context of the banks' sensitivity to\nchanges in interest rates and, in particular, the effect of historically low rates on banks' financial\nperformance and condition. At the same time that declining rates were adversely affecting the\nindustry's interest margins, they were also spurring growth in mortgage-related assets and associated\nloan-origination fees and were producing significant capital gains in bank investment portfolios. Lower\ninterest rates, along with the decline in equity valuations experienced during 2000-2002, also\ncontributed to a substantial inflow of liquid deposits by lessening their opportunity cost.\nUnder these circumstances, and with a steep yield curve, a banker's natural inclination might be to\nshift the credit mix and extend the maturity of assets in an attempt to bolster asset yields. To some\nextent such actions have been taken. Residential mortgage loans and pass-through securities have\nincreased from 17.5 percent of assets in 2000 to 20 percent in 2003. But the manner in which this\ngrowth has occurred suggests a balanced assessment of risk. Call Report data indicate that a\nsubstantial portion of the increase in mortgage assets has been in adjustable-rate or shorter-term\nmortgages, particularly at smaller banks. For their part, large institutions also have significant capacity\nto offset on-balance-sheet exposures through off-balance-sheet transactions.\nAll told, the available data, industry and supervisory judgments, and the long and successful\nexperience of the U.S. commercial banking system in dealing with changing rates suggest that, in\ngeneral, the industry is adequately managing its interest rate exposure. Many banks indicate that they\nnow either are interest-rate neutral or are positioned to benefit from rising rates. These views are\nbased partly on specific steps that they have taken to adjust portfolios and partly on judgments about\nthe effects that rising interest rates would have in easing pressure on interest margins. That is, many\nbanks seem to believe that as rates rise - presumably along with greater economic growth - they can\nincrease lending rates more than they will need to increase rates paid on deposits. Certainly, there are\nalways outliers, and some banks would undoubtedly be hurt by rising rates. However, the industry\nappears to have been sufficiently mindful of interest rate cycles and not to have exposed itself to\nundue risk.\nIn other areas, earlier concerns about the effect of the century date change on computer systems, the\ndestruction of infrastructure in the September 11 attacks, and the increased volume and scope of\nbanking transactions generally have also required financial institutions, particularly large institutions, to\ndevote more effort and resources to contingency planning in order to ensure the continuity of their\noperations. Last fall's power outage and Hurricane Isabel may have offered only limited tests of the\nindustry's improved procedures, but financial firms handled those challenges extremely well.\nAs the nation's central bank and as a bank supervisor, the Federal Reserve has a strong interest in\nthe continued operation of the U.S. financial system after a disruptive event. To that point, last year,\nthe Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency jointly issued an interagency paper, \"Sound Practices to Strengthen the\nResilience of the U.S. Financial System.\" That paper provides guidance that supplements\nlong-standing principles of business continuity planning and disaster recovery and is directed at the\nentities that pose systemic risk to the financial system, particularly in the context of their clearing and\nsettlement activities. Through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, we also issued\nrevised examination guidance on business continuity planning. This guidance covers a variety of\nthreats to business operations, including terrorism, and will be used in future examinations.\nImproved risk management in banks\nIndependent of continuity planning for unusual events, the basic thrust of recent efforts to improve the\nmanagement of risk has been better quantification and the creation of a formal and more-disciplined\nprocess for recognizing, pricing, and managing risk of all types. In the area of credit risk, by providing\nthose involved with a stronger, more-informed basis for making judgments, this development has\nenhanced the interaction between lending and risk-control officers. Operating with better information\ndoes not mean that banks will necessarily reduce credit availability for riskier borrowers. It does mean\nthat banks can more knowingly choose their risk profiles and price risk accordingly. Better,\nmore-informed lending practices should also lead to a more-efficient allocation of scarce financial\ncapital to the benefit of the economy at large.\nGreater internal transparency and quantification of risk have helped bank managers monitor portfolio\nperformance and identify aspects of the risk-measurement and credit-granting process that begin to\nmove off track. As risk-measurement and disclosure practices evolve, investors and uninsured\ncreditors will also become more motivated and better positioned to understand the risk profile of banks\nand convey their own views of banking risks. Indeed, accommodating greater and more-informed\nmarket discipline is an important goal of bank supervisors.\nPerhaps most important, better risk management has already begun to show real potential for\nreducing the wide swings in bank credit availability that historically have been associated with the\neconomic cycle. Sound procedures for risk quantification generally lead to tighter controls and\nassigned responsibilities and to less unintended acceptance of risk during both the strengthening and\nweakening phases of the business cycle. Earlier detection of deviations from expectations leads to\nearlier corrective actions by bank managers and, as necessary, by bank supervisors.\nBetter methods for measuring credit risk have also spurred growth in secondary markets for weak or\nproblem assets, which have provided banks with a firmer, sounder basis for valuing these credits and\nan outlet for selling them and limiting future loss. Insurance companies, hedge funds, and other\ninvestors acquire these assets at discounts that they judge are sufficient to meet their expected\nreturns and balance their portfolio risks. The result is greater liquidity for this segment of bank loan\nportfolios and the earlier removal of weakening credits from bank balance sheets. Portfolio risks have\nalso been increasingly hedged by transactions that do not require asset sales, such as derivatives that\ntransfer credit risk.\nWith greater use, more-thorough review, and more-extensive historical data, risk modeling has\nimproved in accuracy and will continue to do so. Supervisors are also learning these techniques and\nare pressing banks to improve their own methods and systems to keep up with the latest\ndevelopments. In the United States, our leading banking organizations began the process years ago\nand, in many respects, were in the vanguard of the effort worldwide. Nevertheless, they and the\nrisk-measurement process itself have much further to go.\nRecent initiatives of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to revise international capital\nstandards have helped focus attention on risk-measurement practices and have encouraged further\ninvestment in this area. Moreover, the very improvements in technology that facilitated better bank risk\nmeasurement and management have undermined the current regulatory capital regime by creating\ntransactions and instruments that were not conceived when the current regulatory standard was\ndeveloped.\nAlthough these developments have sometimes helped banks circumvent existing rules, they have also\nenabled banks to hedge portfolio risk in ways that the current accord does not address well. As a\nresult, the current regulatory capital standard is increasingly unable to establish capital requirements\nfor our largest and most-complex banking organizations that reflect their true underlying risks. We\nneed a more accurate, more risk-sensitive measure of capital adequacy to provide these institutions\nwith appropriate risk-management incentives and to provide ourselves with a more reliable basis for\nsupervising them in a way that focuses on true risks. In the process, such a measure should also\nenhance our efforts in taking prompt corrective action. For all these reasons, I believe the U.S.\nbanking agencies must remain committed to the process of developing and applying a revised\nregulatory capital standard for the world's international banks.\nProposed capital standards\nLast summer, the U.S. banking agencies took another step toward adopting the new capital standard\nby issuing for public comment an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR). The conception and\ndesign of the proposed standard, referred to as Basel II, are based on techniques developed in recent\nyears by the largest banks, especially those, as I noted, in this country. As the scale and complexity of\ntheir activities grew, the banks needed to find better and more efficient ways to understand, manage,\nand control their risk-taking activities; to promote and respond to the emergence of new markets, such\nas those for securitized assets; and to make greater use of available technology and financial theory in\nmeasuring and managing their risks.\nBefore the agencies issued the ANPR, numerous changes in the proposed Basel II Accord had\nalready been made in light of earlier comments. Reflecting the comments received on the ANPR, the\nBasel Committee agreed to extend the period for reaching an agreement in principle until mid-2004 to\npermit more time for revisions of the proposal to be formulated. Indeed, we have already negotiated\nsome major changes in the international proposal to reflect U.S. public comments. These changes\ninclude the adoption of a framework based on unexpected loss and a revised set of rules on\nsecuritization. We have also modified the implementation process to ease the burden on banking\norganizations that operate across borders. These technical changes were high on the list of\nmodifications suggested by commenters.\nThe shift from a combined \"expected\" and \"unexpected\" loss framework to one that focuses on\nregulatory\nunexpected loss only is crucial to ensuring that the capital framework is consistent with\nstandard internal banking practices, both here and abroad. That change will also simplify other parts of\nthe proposal. The modification on securitization was imperative to permit U.S. banks to continue\nparticipating in important funding markets that they pioneered and to ensure a prudent risk-sensitive\ncapital treatment for securitization exposures. Beyond these achievements, working groups in Basel\nare considering other U.S. proposals related to refining measures of expected loss, an issue that a\nnumber of commenters raised. The U.S. agencies are still trying to reach a consensus on a revised\nproposal for capital charges on retail credit to put before our colleagues in Basel. The Federal\nReserve, for its part, will continue to make every effort to reach consensus on this issue that is both\nrisk-sensitive and workable.\nI believe that all the federal banking agencies are committed to achieving a revised accord that reflects\nthe realities of the twenty-first century; that meets our needs for a safe, sound, and competitive\nbanking system; and that addresses the legitimate concerns of the industry. The Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation has raised important issues about capital adequacy, and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency has expressed significant concerns about a capital structure that may\ninadvertently disrupt retail credit operations of banks. All the agencies are addressing these concerns\nby jointly developing proposals to bring to Basel. In working to reach full agreement among ourselves,\nand ultimately with our colleagues abroad, we all seek a solution that promotes sound banking\npractices and that we can adequately implement and enforce. I hope that in the days ahead the\nagencies can close the gap on credit cards within such an overarching framework.\nIf we can do so, the Basel Committee should be able to reach agreement in principle on a new\nproposal around midyear, and the U.S. banking agencies expect to evaluate that proposal through\nanother \"quantitative impact study\" that we plan to conduct at large U.S. banks this fall. Committee\nmembers are aware that this survey and public comments on a forthcoming Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking may raise still further issues that will need to be addressed before we can implement\nBasel II in the United States. Of course, other countries have their own national and European\nUnion-wide review processes to conclude, and those consultations too, may raise issues that will\nrequire additional attention.\nAs this committee knows, the U.S. agencies have proposed that in this country the most-advanced\nversion of Basel II is to be required only of the largest, most-complex banking organizations, although\nwe anticipate that some of the other larger banks also will choose to adopt that version. Non-adopters\nin the United States will continue to operate under the current capital rules. The current regulatory\ncapital regime, as I noted, has become less effective for the largest organizations while consolidation\nhas sharply increased the scale and scope of their activities. In this country, the Basel II proposal\nfocuses on them. The current rules remain appropriate and prudent for other banking organizations in\nthe United States, and the agencies have decided that imposing the cost of new rules on these\nbanking organizations does not pass a cost-benefit test.\nNonetheless, change in the procedures for calculating regulatory capital for larger banks creates\nuncertainty among those entities to which the new rules would not apply. The comments we received\non the ANPR and from the Congress last year indicate that some smaller banks are concerned that\ntheir competitive environment will change. More specifically, these fears include the possibility that\nBasel II will induce adopters, who are likely to have reductions in regulatory capital requirements, to\nredeploy their capital by acquiring non-adopters or to gain a competitive advantage, particularly in the\nmarkets for small business and residential mortgage loans.\nTo judge the merits of these concerns, the Federal Reserve conducted two technical and empirical\nanalyses of the underlying issues and made the papers available to the public last month;\ncongressional staff members were also briefed. A third study will be completed shortly, and a fourth\nwill commence soon.\nThe first of these papers, dealing with mergers and acquisitions, found virtually no statistical support\nfor the view that either the level of, or changes in, excess regulatory capital have played a role in past\nmerger and acquisition decisions, which suggests that any future effect of Basel II on such decisions is\nalso likely to be quite small. Moreover, reductions in regulatory capital requirements for adopters\nrelative to the requirements for non-adopters are unlikely to lead to an acceleration in the pace of\nconsolidation.\nThe second study evaluated the likely effect of Basel II on the competition between adopters and\nnon-adopters in the market for small- and medium-sized business loans. It estimated that the marginal\ncost of such loans at adopting banks would decline no more than about 16 basis points, on average,\nand is likely to decline by less than that in most cases.\nImportantly, the study also found that most small business loans made by community banks are\nsufficiently different from those made by either required or likely adopters of Basel II as to make any\nmarginal cost differences virtually irrelevant. Moreover, being riskier, the small business loans made\nby most community banks are priced so much above the loans made by the large banks that the\nmarginal cost benefit to adopters would not be a material competitive factor. The study did find,\nlarge\nhowever, that the types of small- and medium-sized business loans made by adopters and other\nbanks are, indeed, similar and similarly priced, so that adopting institutions may have a competitive\nadvantage in many cases over other large banks that choose not to adopt Basel II. I will return to the\nimplication of this finding in a moment.\nA paper analyzing competitive effects in the residential mortgage market will be available later this\nspring, and once the U.S. agencies agree on a proposal regarding the treatment of credit cards, staff\nmembers can begin analyzing potential competitive effects of the proposal in that market, as well. All\nfour papers will then be re-evaluated early next year when new data become available from the\nagencies' next quantitative impact study.\nIf the evidence following these reviews and a public comment process suggests that implementation of\nbifurcated capital standards in this country may affect competition in certain markets, the proposals for\nBasel II may need to be reconsidered. We may need, for example, to modify the application of Basel II\nin the United States, where permissible under the Basel agreement; negotiate further changes in the\ninternational agreement itself; or change the way the current capital rules are applied to institutions\nthat do not adopt the new standard.\nIn short, if we have sufficient indications that implementation of a new capital standard will distort the\nbalance of competition, we can and will apply policies to mitigate this effect consistent with the risk\nprofile of individual institutions. We cannot, however, respond to an unsubstantiated and generalized\nfear of change. Such concerns should not halt the evolution of regulatory capital standards for the\nlarge, complex banking organizations that play such an important role in our banking system and in\nglobal financial markets.\nBank consolidation\nLegislation designed to deregulate U.S. banking markets, technology, and other factors have\ncontributed to significant structural change in the banking industry and to a decline of nearly\n40 percent in the number of banking organizations since the mid-1980s, when industry consolidation\nbegan. Consolidation activity has slowed sharply in the past five years, but a recent uptick in merger\nannouncements, including a couple of very large transactions, may signal a return to a more rapid\npace of bank merger activity. Since 1995, the ten largest U.S. banking organizations have increased\ntheir share of domestic banking assets from 29 percent to 46 percent at year-end 2003. Yet, over the\npast decade, roughly 90 percent of bank mergers have involved a target with less than $1 billion in\nassets, and three-quarters have involved an acquiree with assets of less than $250 million.\nThis ongoing consolidation of the U.S. banking system has not, in my judgment, harmed the overall\ncompetitiveness of our banking and financial markets. Although they have facilitated consolidation, the\nreduced barriers to entry - such as were provided by the Riegle-Neal Act's relaxation of interstate\nbanking laws - have provided net competitive benefits to U.S. consumers of financial services.\nOther economic forces, such as technological change and globalization, have stimulated competition\namong depository institutions and between depositories and nonbank providers of financial services.\nIn addition to other credit-extending businesses, our system of depository institutions alone continues\nto be characterized by many thousands of commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions.\nMeasures of concentration in local banking markets, both urban and rural, have actually declined\nmodestly not just since 2000 but since the mid-1990s. Significantly, most households and small and\nmedium-sized businesses obtain the vast majority of their banking services in such local markets.\nDeposit insurance\nI would like to turn now to the issue of deposit insurance reform and to the need for some legislative\nchange in this area. As the committee knows, most depository institutions have not paid any deposit\ninsurance premiums since 1996, and in fact, some large institutions that have been chartered in the\npast eight years have never paid them at all. Under current conditions, not only is a government\nguarantee being provided free, but also depositories having similar or identical risks are exposed to\npotentially disparate treatment should one, but not the other, of the deposit insurance funds fall below\nits funding target. In that situation, the FDIC would be required to impose a charge on one set of\ndepository institutions while continuing to provide free deposit insurance to those in the other fund.\nBecause some depository institutions today have commingled BIF- and SAIF-insured deposits as a\nresult of bank and thrift mergers, this disparate treatment could apply even to different deposit\naccounts within the same depository institution.\nAt this time, the Congress has the opportunity to provide the FDIC with greater flexibility to charge\nrisk-based premiums, possibly using market data (for example, rates on uninsured deposits) for the\nlargest banks, to allow such premiums to increase or decrease in a gradual manner over a wider\nrange of fund reserve ratios, and to treat all depositories with similar risk ratings equally and equitably.\nSuch reforms should be implemented in a manner that does not unnecessarily create additional moral\nhazard and that strengthens, rather than erodes, market discipline.\nHigher coverage limits, for example, would exacerbate moral hazard problems without apparent and\noffsetting benefits. The current level of coverage seems adequate to meet the needs of an\noverwhelming majority of depositors. First, depositors have certain flexibility in distributing large\nbalances among multiple accounts and depository institutions to obtain higher insurance coverage.\nSecond, the Federal Reserve's latest survey of consumer finances indicates that at year-end 2001\nless than 4 percent of U.S. depositor households had any uninsured deposits. Moreover, the median\nbank IRA/Keogh account balance was only $15,000, well below the existing insurance limit. Finally,\ncommunity banks have shown themselves just as adept as the largest banks in attracting uninsured\ndeposits when necessary to fund customer loan demand.\nConclusion\nIn closing, Mr. Chairman, let me reiterate that the past decade has been one in which the banking\nindustry has recorded persistent record profits while providing an ever-wider range of products and\nservices to much more diverse groups. The industry's experience during the past several years in\ndealing with clear weakness in key economic sectors demonstrates the importance of strong capital\npositions and sound risk-management practices. Bank supervisors worldwide are working to\nencourage further progress in these areas, through more-accurate and more-effective regulatory\ncapital standards based on even better internal risk-management procedures.",

         "Alan Greenspan: The economic outlook\nTestimony by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, before the Joint Economic Committee, US Senate, Washington, 21 April 2004.\n* * *\nMr. Chairman and members of the committee, I am pleased to be here today to offer my views on the\noutlook for the U.S. economy.\nThe economy appears to have emerged around the middle of last year from an extended stretch of\nsubpar growth and entered a period of more vigorous expansion. After having risen at an annual rate\nof 2-1/2 percent in the first half of last year, real GDP increased at an annual pace of more than\n6 percent in the second half. Aided by tax cuts, low interest rates, and rising wealth, household\nspending continued to post sizable gains last year. In addition, an upturn in business investment,\nwhich followed several years of lackluster performance, and a sharp rise in exports contributed\nimportantly to the acceleration in real GDP over 2003.\nAlthough real GDP is not likely to continue advancing at the same pace as in the second half of 2003,\nrecent data indicate that growth of activity has remained robust thus far this year. Household spending\nhas continued to move up, and residential home sales and construction remain at elevated levels. In\naddition, the improvement in business activity has become more widespread. In the industrial sector,\nnearly two-thirds of the industries that make up the index of industrial production have experienced an\nincrease in output over the past three months. More broadly, indicators of business investment point to\nincreases in spending for many types of capital equipment. And importantly, the latest employment\nfigures suggest that businesses are becoming more willing to add to their workforces, with the result\nthat the labor market now appears to be gradually improving after a protracted period of weakness.\nLooking forward, the prospects for sustaining solid economic growth in the period ahead are good.\nMonetary policy remains quite accommodative, with short-term real interest rates still close to zero. In\naddition, fiscal policy will likely continue to provide considerable impetus to domestic spending through\nthe end of this year.\nImportantly, the caution among business executives that had previously led them to limit their capital\nexpenditures appears to be giving way to a growing confidence in the durability of the expansion. That\nconfidence has, no doubt, been bolstered by favorable borrowing conditions, ongoing improvements in\nefficiency, and rising profitability, which have put many firms on a more solid financial footing.\nNevertheless, some of the strains that accompanied the difficult business environment of the past\nseveral years apparently still linger. Although businesses are replacing obsolescent equipment at an\naccelerated pace, many managers continue to exhibit an unusual reluctance to anticipate and prepare\nfor future orders by adding to their capital stock. Despite a dramatic increase in cash flow, business\nfixed and inventory investment, taken together, have risen only moderately. Indeed, internal corporate\nfunds exceeded investment over the course of last year for the first time since 1975.\nSimilar cautious behavior has also been evident in the hiring decisions of U.S. firms, during the past\nseveral years. Rather than seeking profit opportunities in expanding markets, business managers\nhunkered down and focused on repairing severely depleted profitability predominately by cutting costs\nand restricting their hiring. Firms succeeded in that endeavor largely by taking advantage of the\nuntapped potential for increased efficiencies that had built up during the rapid capital accumulation of\nthe latter part of the 1990s. That process has not yet played out completely. Many firms seem to be\ncontinuing to find new ways to exploit the technological opportunities embodied in the substantial\ninvestments in high-tech equipment that they had made over the past decade.\nWhen aggregate demand accelerated in the second half of 2003, the pace of job cuts slowed. But\nbecause of the newfound improvements in the efficiency of their operations, firms were able to meet\nincreasing demand without adding many new workers.\nAs the opportunities to enhance efficiency from the capital investments of the late 1990s inevitably\nbecome scarcer, productivity growth will doubtless slow from its recent phenomenal pace. And, if\ndemand continues to firm, companies will ultimately find that they have no choice but to increase their\nworkforces if they are to address growing backlogs of orders. In such an environment, the pace of\nhiring should pick up on a more sustained basis, bringing with it larger persistent increases in net\nemployment than those prevailing until recently.\nStill, the anxiety that many in our workforce feel will not subside quickly. In March of this year, about\n85,000 jobless individuals per week exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits - more than\ndouble the 35,000 per week in September 2000. Moreover, the average duration of unemployment\nincreased from twelve weeks in September 2000 to twenty weeks in March of this year. These\ndevelopments have led to a notable rise in insecurity among workers.\nMost of the recent increases in productivity have been reflected in a sharp rise in the pretax profits of\nnonfinancial corporations from a very low 7 percent share of that sector's gross value added in the\nthird quarter of 2001 to a high 12 percent share in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in real\nhourly compensation was quite modest over that period. The consequence was a marked fall in the\nratio of employee compensation to gross nonfinancial corporate income to a very low level by the\nstandards of the past three decades.\nIf history is any guide, competitive pressures, at some point, will shift in favor of real hourly\ncompensation at the expense of corporate profits. That shift, coupled with further gains in employment,\nshould cause labor's share of income to begin to rise toward historical norms.\nSuch a process need not add to inflation pressures. Although labor costs, which compose nearly two\nthirds of consolidated costs, no longer seem to be falling at the pace that prevailed in the second half\nof last year, those costs have yet to post a decisive upturn. And even if they do, the current high level\nof profit margins suggests that firms may come under competitive pressure to absorb some\nacceleration of labor costs. Should such an acceleration of costs persist, however, higher price\ninflation would inevitably follow.\nThe pace of economic expansion here and abroad is evidently contributing to some price pressures at\nearlier stages of the production process and in energy markets, and the decline in the dollar's\nexchange rate has fostered a modest firming of core import prices. More broadly, however, although\nthe recent data suggest that the worrisome trend of disinflation presumably has come to an end,\nstill-significant productivity growth and a sizable margin of underutilized resources, to date, have\nchecked any sustained acceleration of the general price level and should continue to do so for a time.\nMoreover, the initial effect of a slowing of productivity growth is more likely to be an easing of profit\nmargins than an acceleration of prices.\nAs I have noted previously, the federal funds rate must rise at some point to prevent pressures on\nprice inflation from eventually emerging. As yet, the protracted period of monetary accommodation has\nnot fostered an environment in which broad-based inflation pressures appear to be building. But the\nFederal Reserve recognizes that sustained prosperity requires the maintenance of price stability and\nwill act, as necessary, to ensure that outcome.",

         "Susan Schmidt Bies: The economic outlook and financial health of bank\ncustomers\nRemarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act Banker Outreach Meeting,\nNashville, Tennessee, 22 April 2004.\n* * *\nI am delighted to be back in Tennessee today and to have a chance to visit with some old friends. I\nalso want to thank you for giving so much of your time to help us identify ways to reduce unnecessary\nand unduly burdensome regulatory requirements on financial institutions. There is a real need to\ncontinually review the cost-benefit nexus of regulations, especially with the fast pace of evolution in\nfinancial markets and institutions. Thus, my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System and I are\nstrong supporters of the goals of today's meeting. It is a critical supplement to our own efforts, which\ninclude a review of our regulations every five years to revise or rescind out-of-date or unnecessary\nrules.\nI thought that after lunch you might find it interesting to shift to a discussion of the financial health of\nbank customers and the economy. In that spirit, I would like to briefly share with you my assessment of\nthe economic outlook and then to discuss in more detail how the evolution of household and business\nbalance sheets in recent years is affecting economic activity. You should understand, however, that I\nam expressing my own opinions, which are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board or on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\nThe economic outlook\nAs you know, real GDP grew at an annual rate of 6.2 percent in the second half of 2003, and the\neconomic fundamentals seem to be in place for another sizable advance this year. Indeed, the central\ntendency range of FOMC-member forecasts is 4-1/2 to 5 percent. Yet despite the recent strong pace\nof economic activity, the labor market has improved at an unusually slow pace by historical standards.\nThe most recent data - indicating a jump in payrolls in March - was good news, and I am cautiously\noptimistic that job growth will pick up further over the remainder of this year. My business contacts tell\nme that companies have become more optimistic about economic prospects and that their plans do\ninclude increases in the size of their payrolls.\nThe latest data on consumer prices suggest that the process of disinflation may have come to an end.\nIn March 2004, the twelve-month change in the core CPI rose to 1.6 percent - essentially the same\npace as in March 2003, and the core PCE price index change from twelve months earlier moved back\nabove the 1 percent level in both February and March. Although the increased pace of economic\nactivity has put some upward pressure on prices at earlier stages of processing and higher energy\nprices are being passed through to the prices of some products, strong productivity growth and slack\nin resource utilization have kept core retail price increases in check.\nHousehold financial conditions\nSome commentators have expressed concern about the rapid growth in household debt in recent\nyears, fearing that households have become overextended and will need to rein in their spending to\nkeep their debt burdens under control. My view, however, is considerably more sanguine. Although\nthere are pockets of financial stress among households, the sector as a whole appears to be in good\nshape.\nAs bankers, you are well aware that households have taken on quite a bit of debt over the past several\nyears. According to the latest available data, total household debt grew at an annual rate of 10 percent\nbetween the end of 1999 and the fourth quarter of 2003; in comparison, after-tax household income\nincreased at a rate of 5 percent. But looking below the aggregate data, we must understand that the\nrapid growth in household debt reflects largely a surge in mortgage borrowing, which has been fueled\nby historically low mortgage interest rates and strong growth in house prices.\nIndeed, many homeowners have taken advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages,\nsome having done so several times over the past couple of years. Survey data suggest that\nhomeowners took out cash in more than one-half of these \"refis,\" often to pay down loans with higher\ninterest rates. On net, the resulting drop in the average interest rate on household borrowings,\ncombined with the lengthening maturity of their total debt, has tempered the monthly payment\nobligations from the growing stock of homeowners' outstanding debt.\nThe Federal Reserve publishes two series that quantify the burden of household obligations. The first\nseries, the debt service ratio, measures the required payments on mortgage and consumer debt as a\nshare of after-tax personal income. The second series, the financial obligations ratio, is a broader\nversion of the debt service ratio that includes required household payments on rent, auto leases,\nhomeowners' insurance, and property taxes. Both ratios rose during the 1990s, and both reached a\npeak in late 2001. Since then, however, they have receded slightly on net from their respective peaks,\nan indication that households, in the aggregate, have been keeping an eye on repayment burdens.\nBecause the debt service ratio and the financial obligations ratio are calculated from aggregate data,\nthey do not necessarily indicate whether the typical household is experiencing financial stress.\nNonetheless, we have found that changes in either ratio help predict future changes in consumer loan\ndelinquencies. Accordingly, the fact that these ratios have come off their recent peaks is a hopeful sign\nabout household loan performance. Indeed, delinquency rates for a wide range of household loans\nturned down over the second half of 2003.\nAnother often-cited indicator of household financial conditions is the personal bankruptcy rate.\nMovements in the bankruptcy rate, to be sure, partly reflect changes in the incidence of financial\nstress, but the rate has been trending up for more than two decades for a variety of other reasons. The\nBankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 made bankruptcy a more attractive option for most households by\nincreasing the amount of wealth that households could retain after bankruptcy. Other factors that have\nlikely contributed to the upward trend are the decrease in the social stigma of filing for bankruptcy and\nthe growing access to credit in the United States. As lenders have become more sophisticated in their\nability to assess the riskiness of borrowers, they have extended loans to households that were\npreviously denied credit. These households are more likely to default on their obligations than the\ntypical borrower, but this increased risk is priced into loan terms. Although the bankruptcy rate remains\nelevated, it has edged down on balance in recent months, likely because of the pickup in economic\ngrowth in the United States since mid-2003.\nThis relatively upbeat assessment of household credit quality seems to be shared by lenders and by\ninvestors in securities backed by consumer debt. According to the Federal Reserve's survey of senior\nloan officers, the number of banks tightening their standards on consumer loans has fallen over the\npast year. This behavior certainly does not point to much concern about household loan performance.\nMoreover, one gets an even more positive message from the credit spreads on securities backed by\nauto loans and credit card receivables. In recent months, the spreads between the yields on these\nsecurities and swap rates of comparable maturities have narrowed across the credit spectrum.\nThus far, I have focused on the liability side of the household balance sheet, but there have been\nfavorable developments on the asset side as well. Equity prices rallied strongly last year and have\ncontinued to rise this year, reversing a good chunk of the losses sustained over the previous three\nyears. In addition, home prices appreciated sharply during each year from 1997 to 2003. The\ncumulative rise since the late 1990s has exceeded the growth in per capita income by a wide margin.\nAll told, the ratio of household net worth to disposable income - a useful summary of the sector's\nfinancial position - recovered last year to stand at a level about equal to its average over the past\ndecade.\nBefore I turn to the business sector, let me address the frequently expressed concern that a bubble\nmay have developed in house prices after several years of rapid increases. Some of the measured\nprice rise results from improvements in the quality of houses. Houses are bigger and have more\namenities than in the past, two characteristics that will lead to rising average house prices over time.\nBut even after one controls for quality, increases in home prices have been outstripping general price\ninflation by a considerable margin in recent years.\nOnce again, the low interest rates are probably an important factor. Houses, like other assets,\ngenerate an expected stream of future benefits. With low interest rates, these future benefits are\ndiscounted less heavily, which raises the asset's price today. Low interest rates also push up house\nprices by boosting the demand for housing. Of course, some of that increased demand is being met by\nthe rapid pace of construction of new housing. But building houses takes time, and in the interim,\nhigher demand will push up the price of existing houses.\nAlthough we can identify the key forces behind the rise in house prices in recent years, we cannot be\nsure that the increases are fully justified by the prevailing fundamentals. Still, we need to keep the\nrecent increases in house prices in perspective: Although house prices have been outstripping broad\nmeasures of inflation - even after adjusting for quality improvements - their rise is nothing like the\nincrease in stock market prices in the late 1990s.\nIn fact, the speculative forces that can sometimes drive equity prices to extremes are less likely to\nemerge in housing prices. First, buying and selling houses is a lot more expensive and cumbersome\nthan buying and selling equities, which makes taking a speculative position in houses much more\ndifficult. Second, housing markets are much more local than equity markets, which are national, if not\nglobal, in scope. So if any speculative frenzy emerged, it would be much less likely to spread in the\nhousing markets than in equity markets. Finally, financial institutions have a much more disciplined\nprocess regarding the housing and construction lending market than they did in past housing cycles.\nLenders today are cautious about lending for speculative purposes, and appraised values undergo\nmore scrutiny than in the past. The expansion of credit to higher risk households may also have driven\nbanks to strengthen their underwriting procedures.\nThat said, local housing markets can certainly become overvalued and then experience sharp price\ndeclines. House prices fell significantly in several parts of the country in the early 1990s. But because\nthe transactions costs are much higher in the housing market than in the equity market and because\nthe underlying demand for living space is much more predictable than are the prospects for any given\nfirm, the large increases and decreases often observed in the stock market are less likely to occur in\nthe market for houses. In addition, lenders are much more responsive to local economic conditions\nand generally become more cautious in loan underwriting when unsold homes or local unemployment\nincrease.\nFinancial conditions of businesses\nThe change in the economy that caught my attention in the second half of 2003 was that the decline in\nbusiness fixed investment had finally ceased. Capital spending by businesses posted a solid increase\nin the second half of last year, and orders and shipments for nondefense capital goods - key indicators\nof equipment spending - point to further sizable gains. Moreover, the tenor of anecdotes from the\ncorporate sector has become comparatively upbeat, with corporate managers seeing stronger revenue\ngrowth and a much improved and more accommodative financing environment.\nFour factors have contributed to this improvement in financial conditions: low interest rates, a\nwidespread restructuring of corporate liabilities during the past few years, a sharp rebound in\ncorporate profitability from its trough in 2001, and a substantial narrowing in market risk premiums. In\naddition, the burden of underfunded pension plans, perhaps the most prominent negative financial\nfactor that remains, has eased of late. I will discuss each factor in turn.\nFirst, firms are continuing to benefit from the accommodative stance of monetary policy. With the\nfederal funds rate at 1 percent, short-term borrowing costs remain very low. For longer-term debt, the\ncombination of low yields on benchmark Treasury securities and reduced risk spreads has kept\nborrowing costs attractive. Indeed, the yield on Moody's Baa corporate bond index is at its lowest\nsustained level since 1968.\nSecond, in response to low long-term rates and to investors' concerns arising from some high-profile,\nunanticipated meltdowns, firms have greatly strengthened their balance sheets. Many firms have\nrefinanced high-cost debt, which has reduced the average interest rate on the debt of nonfinancial\ncorporations more than 1 percentage point since the end of 2000. Businesses also have substituted\nlong-term debt for short-maturity debt to improve their balance sheet liquidity and to reduce the risk of\nrolling over funds. In addition, many firms - especially in the most troubled industries - have retired\ndebt through equity offerings and asset sales, which limited the growth of nonfinancial corporate debt\nin 2002 and 2003 to the slowest pace since the early 1990s.\nThird, firms have significantly tightened their belts. Over the past two years, the drive to cut costs has\ngenerated rapid productivity gains. This greater efficiency boosted corporate profitability in 2002 and\n2003 despite rather tepid revenue growth. Moreover, a pickup in revenue growth in the second half of\nlast year helped companies leverage those productivity gains, producing a dramatic recovery in overall\ncorporate profitability. Over 2003, economic profits before tax surged more than 18 percent, bringing\nprofit margins to their highest levels in several years.\nFourth, risk premiums fell substantially last year as corporate governance scandals receded and\ninvestor sentiment turned markedly more positive. The recovery in stock prices reflects this brighter\nview. Spreads on corporate bonds have narrowed appreciably - especially for the riskiest firms - and\nthey now stand at the lowest levels in several years. This decline in spreads has been helped by the\nbeneficial effect of the balance sheet improvements that I mentioned a moment ago. Indicators of\ncorporate financial stress, such as bond rating downgrades and default rates, have returned to levels\nnormally associated with economic expansion. Delinquency rates on business loans at commercial\nbanks have also declined, and our surveys indicate that, on balance, banks have recently eased the\nterms and standards on such loans for both large and small firms.\nAnother sign of improved sentiment is that money has been flowing into riskier securities. For\nexample, net inflows to equity mutual funds have been strong for about a year, and high-yield bond\nfunds, too, registered strong net inflows in 2003. Junk bond issuance has picked up notably, and the\nmarket for initial public equity offerings has also shown signs of recovery, while investors still appear to\nbe more selective than during the boom in the late 1990s.\nThese four points all suggest that financial conditions are capable of supporting a sustained, healthy\npickup in economic growth. The much improved profitability can help finance expansion directly out of\ninternal funds or indirectly by supporting firms' borrowing capacity. Furthermore, firms will be able to\ndraw on their liquid assets that have accumulated over the past couple of years. And given the\nsuccessful efforts to pare costs, firms are set to benefit from new investment in plant and equipment.\nPerhaps the biggest financial hurdle still facing many corporations is the burden of underfunding in\ntheir defined-benefit (DB) pension plans, but even here we have seen some improvement. Stock\nmarket losses during 2000 to 2002 had significantly eroded the value of pension assets, while sharply\ndeclining interest rates had raised the current value of plan liabilities. As a result, the majority of S&P\n500 plans were underfunded at the end of 2002, with a net shortfall that exceeded $200 billion. Thus,\nmany companies needed to make additional contributions, in some cases quite substantial, to their\npension plans. In 2002, S&P 500 firms contributed $46 billion to their pension plans - three times more\nthan in either of the previous two years - and total contributions are estimated to have been even\nhigher in 2003.\nThis drain on corporate sponsors' cash resources is likely to ease in the near term, but longer-term\nissues remain. DB pension asset values have benefited from robust returns in equity markets since\nearly last year. And earlier this month the President signed legislation that allows firms to reduce plan\ncontributions for two years by permitting them to use a corporate bond rate rather than a Treasury\nbond rate to calculate liabilities. But beyond the near-term, firms with DB pensions tend to be in\nmaturing industries with aging workforces, for which the growth of liabilities are high and rising. This\nlonger-term challenge will remain even if the current favorable market conditions are sustained.\nConclusion\nIn summary, recent indicators suggest that the pace of economic activity remains solid, while\ninflationary pressures continue to be subdued. In addition, the household and business sectors are, by\nand large, in good financial shape. Although uncertainties remain, I believe that the fundamentals are\nin place to generate sustainable economic growth.",

         "Ben S Bernanke: The economic outlook and monetary policy\nRemarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Bond Market Association Annual Meeting, New York, 22 April 2004.\nThe references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.\n* * *\nI am pleased to have the opportunity to address the members of the Bond Market Association. I know\nthat you have a keen interest in the likely future course of the economy and of monetary policy, so I\nwill use my time today to comment on both topics. I will begin with the economic outlook, discussing\nprospects for economic growth, the labor market, and inflation, and conclude by drawing some\nimplications for monetary policy. As always, my views are my responsibility alone and are not to be\nascribed to my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.1\nThe prospects for economic growth\nBroadly, the economy has shown substantially increased vitality since the middle of last year, and with\nthe passage of time the economic recovery has shown increasing signs of becoming self-sustaining.\nJudging from the most recent data, growth in domestic spending appears consistent with growth in\nreal gross domestic product (GDP) in the range of 4-1/2 to 5 percent for the first quarter and at a rate\nof 4 percent or higher for 2004 as a whole. One reason for increased confidence that the recovery is\nbecoming self-sustaining is that the expansion of aggregate demand has become more broad-based,\nwith households, firms, and government all making contributions to spending growth.\nHousehold spending, which has not slackened significantly at any point in the past three years, has\ncontinued its advance, supported by positive wealth effects and tax cuts. Except for a modest decline\nin auto sales (relative to the strong pace of the previous quarter), consumer expenditures on most\nmajor categories of goods and services were well sustained in the first quarter, as recent data on retail\nsales testify. Household spending is likely to continue to grow at a solid pace for the remainder of this\nyear, especially if the job market improves as expected.\nA question that many have asked is whether household spending, including spending on new homes,\nwill remain strong if interest rates rise. I think that consumers are not badly positioned for a normal\ncyclical increase in interest rates. The balance sheets of most households are in good shape: Perhaps\nmost important, the ratio of household net worth to income is relatively high, not far below its\npre-recession level. Also, households took advantage of low long-term rates during the last cycle to\nreduce their exposure to short-term and high-interest debt. Although household debt burdens have\nrisen, most household debt today is in the form of mortgage debt, of which some 85 to 90 percent is at\nfixed rates and thus insulated from interest-rate increases.\nThe decision to purchase a home is probably the most interest-sensitive decision made by\nhouseholds. Private housing starts rebounded in March from a possibly weather-related dip in\nFebruary, and sales of new and existing homes during the first quarter remained close to record\nlevels. I expect residential investment to continue strong this year. Mortgage rates have risen in the\npast month but remain low relative to historical experience, while new household formation, improved\njob prospects, and income growth should ensure a continued healthy demand for housing. However,\nresidential investment is unlikely to rise much further from current high levels and thus its contribution\nto GDP growth over the next year or two can be expected to decline.\nEnergy price increases have reduced households' real disposable personal income by about\n$30 billion since December. This development will probably shave a tenth or two from the growth in\npersonal consumption expenditures in 2004 but thus far, at least, the rise in energy prices does not\nmaterially affect the outlook.\nA key factor in the economic turnaround in the third quarter of 2003 was the resurgence in business\nfixed investment, particularly in equipment and software. That component of spending seems set to\ncontinue to expand as output grows, profits improve, and firms become more confident in the durability\nof the recovery. Double-digit growth in real spending on equipment and software seems quite possible\nthis year, in part because the expiration of partial expensing allowances at the end of 2004 will lead\nsome firms to move forward investment they otherwise would have made in 2005. Given the very low\ninventory stocks currently held by businesses, inventory investment should also support growth. In\ncontrast, nonresidential investment remains weak, reflecting low capacity utilization rates in factories\nand high vacancy rates in office buildings, and the improvement in that sector seems likely to be\ngradual.\nThe Federal government's budget deficit is expected to peak this year at something between\n$450 billion and $500 billion. Both increased government expenditures and reduced taxes will support\ngrowth in aggregate demand in 2004, though fiscal policy will provide somewhat less impetus and may\neven be slightly restrictive in 2005. U.S. exports are likely to continue their recent rise, because of a\nweaker dollar and economic recovery among our trading partners. However, rising U.S. incomes will\nspur imports as well. On net, the external sector will probably continue to be a slight drag on U.S.\ngrowth, and little if any progress is likely to be made in closing the current account deficit this year.\nThe state of the labor market\nAs you know, the recovery in labor markets has not kept pace with the recovery in output, an issue\nthat has been central in recent debates about economic policy. As has been widely noted, the leading\nexplanation for the slow recovery in the labor market has been the remarkable ability of employers and\nworkers to increase labor productivity. Over the four quarters of 2003, output per hour in the nonfarm\nbusiness sector is estimated to have risen 5.4 percent, up from an already robust 4.3 percent gain the\nprevious year. Output per hour probably grew at a rate exceeding 4 percent in the first quarter of this\nyear, accounting for the lion's share of growth during the quarter. Although these productivity\nincreases are unalloyed good news for the U.S. economy in the longer term, in the short run they have\nallowed firms to expand production rapidly while adding fewer workers than would be normal in a\ncyclical expansion. I and many others have argued that this situation cannot persist: As managers\nexhaust the possibilities for outsized productivity gains and become convinced of the durability of the\nexpansion, they should become increasingly more willing to add employees (Bernanke, 2003b).\nUnfortunately, the pace of productivity gains and hence of employment growth has proved difficult to\nforecast.\nIf we look past the erratic month-to-month changes in payrolls, the labor market does appear to be\ngradually improving. On average, private nonfarm payrolls grew by 161,000 per month in the first\nquarter, up from 58,000 per month in the fourth quarter of 2003. Recent employment gains have not\nbeen confined to a few industries. For example, in March the one-month employment diffusion index,\nwhich measures the proportion of industries with expanding employment relative to the share of\nindustries with contracting employment, reached its highest value since July 2000. Initial claims for\nunemployment insurance have also been falling and are now at pre-recession levels. The decline in\ninitial claims is consistent with other data that suggest that the pace of layoffs has slackened\nconsiderably. The rate of new hiring has been exceptionally sluggish for the past several years,\nhowever, and the available evidence suggests modest improvement at best in hiring rates so far this\nyear.\nAlthough the labor market appears to be sitting up and taking fluids, it has not hopped out of bed and\nbegun a round of jumping jacks. Despite the strong payroll gains in March, nonfarm payrolls remain\n343,000 below their level of November 2001, the official trough of the recession, and private nonfarm\npayrolls are more than half a million below the trough level. The average workweek of production and\nnonsupervisory workers declined slightly in March; at 33.7 hours, the workweek is low on an absolute\nbasis and barely above the 33.6 hours average attained during the third quarter of last year, the lowest\nquarterly figure in 2003.\nThe data I have cited thus far come from reports provided by employers, through what is known as the\npayroll survey. Much has been made of the differences between the results of the payroll survey and\nthose from the household survey, which is based on the responses from a random sample of\nhouseholds.2 When its coverage is adjusted to be comparable to that of the payroll survey, the\nhousehold survey shows a net gain of about 1.7 million jobs since the November 2001 trough,\ncompared with the already noted loss of more than 300,000 jobs reported by the payroll survey. Since\nJune of last year, when the pace of output growth picked up significantly, employment as measured by\nthe household survey (on a comparable payroll basis) has risen by 1.42 million jobs, more than double\nthe increase of 689,000 jobs reported by the payroll survey. Recent revisions of both surveys - in the\ncase of the household survey, to take into account the likelihood that immigration to the United States\nsince 2003 has been below earlier estimates - have only modestly reduced the gap in estimated job\ncreation.3\nAlthough resolving the differences between the two surveys is important, my own assessment of the\nlabor market does not change markedly even if substantial credence is given to the data drawn from\nthe household survey. For example, although the unemployment rate (measured by the household\nsurvey) has fallen to 5.7 percent from its peak of 6.3 percent last June, that rate remains high relative\nto recent experience and in comparison to most plausible recent estimates of the sustainable rate of\nunemployment. The evidence suggests, moreover, that the official unemployment rate of 5.7 percent\nunderstates to some extent the true amount of slack in the labor market. Notably, to a greater degree\nthan in past cycles, discouraged job seekers have been withdrawing from the labor market rather than\nreporting themselves as unemployed. According to the household survey, the labor force participation\nrate has actually declined significantly since the official trough of the cycle, from 66.7 percent of the\nworking-age population in November 2001 to 65.9 percent in March 2004.4 From its peak last June,\nthe unemployment rate has fallen by 0.6 percentage point, from 6.3 percent to 5.7 percent. However,\nduring the same period, the labor force participation rate also fell by 0.6 percentage point, from\n66.5 percent to its current value of 65.9 percent. The net result is that the employment-to-population\nratio has barely changed since the middle of last year. Thus even the household survey, its relatively\nmore encouraging job-creation numbers notwithstanding, paints a picture of ongoing softness in the\nlabor market. So long as the labor market is weak, the economic recovery will be incomplete. Indeed,\nby reducing confidence and spending, a failure of the labor market to improve could conceivably\nthreaten the sustainability of the expansion.\nOne way to see the extent of the slack in the labor market, as measured even by the household\nsurvey, is to ask how much job creation would be needed to bring the unemployment rate down\nfurther. Underlying the household survey's employment calculations is an estimate that the adult\nnon-institutional population grew in March by 193,000 people. If the population grows by the same\nabsolute amount in April and the labor force participation rate remains unchanged at 65.9 percent, the\nlabor force will grow by about 127,000 during the month. To keep the unemployment rate at\n5.7 percent in April, then, household employment (as opposed to payroll employment) would have to\ngrow by 120,000 jobs. To reduce the unemployment rate under these assumptions, of course, more\nthan 120,000 net new jobs would be needed.\nThe standard calculation I just presented was based on the assumption that the rate of labor force\nparticipation does not change, an assumption that may not be valid during a cyclical recovery in the\nlabor market. If people perceive a significant improvement in the job market, new job seekers may\nenter or re-enter the labor force as employment grows. To illustrate the possible implications, let us\nsuppose that improving job prospects lead the participation rate to rise 0.1 percentage point in April,\nfrom 65.9 percent to 66.0 percent. (Remember, the rate was 66.5 percent as recently as last June.)\nThis increase in the participation rate would imply a total increase in the labor force (including the\nportion attributed to the rise in population) of some 350,000 people and hence a need for more than\n330,000 net new jobs to keep the unemployment rate from rising. The implication is that, with the labor\nmarket still in a relatively early stage of its cyclical recovery, an unusually high rate of job creation may\nbe required for a time to bring the labor market back into balance.\nIn short, the unusual rate of productivity growth has driven a wedge between the recovery in output\nand the recovery in the labor market, leaving considerable cyclical slack in the labor market despite\nongoing growth in output. The economic recovery will not be fully realized, in my view, until the labor\nmarket has established a more normal cyclical pattern of expansion.5\nThe outlook for inflation\nForecasts of inflation, particularly core inflation (which excludes the more volatile energy and food\nprice components), are of course another key input to monetary policy decisions. The core inflation\ndata for the past couple of months have been slightly above market expectations. More time will be\nneeded to assess the significance of these recent numbers; possibly, they may reflect the unwinding\nof some downward surprises to core inflation late last year. Based on the information currently\navailable, my own best guess is that core inflation has stopped falling and appears to be stabilizing in\nthe vicinity of 1-1/2 percent, comfortably within my own preferred range of 1 to 2 percent.\nThe dominant fundamental factors influencing the inflation outlook are the ongoing resource slack and\nthe remarkable rate of productivity growth. Together, these factors imply that unit labor costs will either\ncontinue to fall or at least remain quiescent. Moreover, price-cost margins are at high levels (as can be\nseen in the strong growth of profits), providing an additional cushion for absorbing any inflation\npressures that may emerge on the cost side. These forces should largely offset the effects on core\nconsumer price inflation of the rising costs of raw materials - the byproduct of the gathering global\nrecovery and continuing rapid growth in East Asia - and last year's decline in the foreign exchange\nvalue of the dollar. As I discussed in some detail in a speech earlier this year (Bernanke, 2004a), the\ndirect effects of commodity price increases and a depreciating dollar on inflation at the consumer level\nare generally small. This modest direct impact reflects the small share of total costs accounted for by\nraw materials and imported inputs as well as the fact that a portion of cost increases tends to be\nabsorbed in producers' margins.\nIn thinking about the implications of higher commodity prices for inflation, one should also make the\ndistinction between a one-time rise in commodity prices and an ongoing process of commodity price\ninflation. Commodity prices can only contribute to inflation at the consumer level when they are rapidly\nrising. Commodity prices may well remain high in an absolute sense over the next few years because\nof the high global demand for raw materials. Yet if the rate of increase in commodity prices slows\nsignificantly, as is implied for example by futures prices, the effect of commodity prices on the rate of\ninflation will eventually become negligible. Similarly, dollar depreciation contributes to inflation only to\nthe extent that it is ongoing; we cannot predict whether last year's decline in the dollar will continue, of\ncourse, but so far this year it has not.\nIn describing what I consider to be the most likely scenario for inflation, I do not wish to convey an\nunwarranted degree of certainty. Like employment, inflation is difficult to forecast. One factor that may\nbe of great importance in inflation determination but can be particularly hard to gauge is the state of\nthe public's inflation expectations (Poole, 2004). For example, wages and prices that are set for some\nperiod in the future will of necessity embody the inflation expectations of the parties to the negotiation;\nincreases in expected inflation will thus tend to promote greater actual inflation. More subtly, my\nconclusion that the effects on inflation of transitory changes in commodity prices or in the value of the\ndollar tend to dissipate in the longer run depends on the assumption that the public's inflation\nexpectations are well anchored. If expectations are not well tied down, inflationary impulses that are in\nthemselves transitory may become embedded in expectations and hence affect inflation in the longer\ninflation\nterm. Therefore, an essential prerequisite for controlling is controlling inflation expectations.\nAssessing the current state of inflation expectations in the United States is not entirely straightforward.\nSurvey measures of near-term inflation expectations, including those based on interviews of\nprofessional forecasters, individual consumers, and firm managers, have in some cases ticked up\nslightly in recent months, though long-term inflation expectations appear stable. The spread between\nthe yields on Treasury debt and inflation-indexed Treasury securities of similar maturity, known as the\nbreakeven inflation rate and conventionally treated as an indicator of expected inflation, has also risen.\nFrom a policy perspective, a difficulty with all these measures is that they reflect expectations of\nheadline inflation rather than the core inflation measures usually emphasized in the monetary policy\ncontext. Headline inflation has of course been significantly affected by the recent surge in energy\nprices. The breakeven inflation rate derived from indexed Treasury securities has additional problems\nas a measure of expected inflation. As I discussed in a recent speech (Bernanke, 2004b), breakeven\ninflation may differ substantially from the market's true expectation of inflation because of possibly\ntime-varying risk and liquidity premiums. I will discuss inflation expectations further in the context of\nmonetary policy, to which I turn next.\nMonetary policy\nThe federal funds rate stands at a historically low level of 1 percent, and the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) has declared its intention to be \"patient in removing policy accommodation.\" As a\nnumber of my FOMC colleagues have noted in various public venues, inevitably the funds rate will\nhave to return to a more normal level. What considerations should the Committee keep in mind as it\nplans this normalization process?\nBefore addressing this question, I would like to point out that, in an appropriately broad sense,\nmonetary conditions in the United States are already in the process of normalizing. I base this\nstatement on my view that the stance of monetary policy should be judged not only by the current\nsetting of the federal funds rate but also by the level of rates that are tied directly or indirectly to\nexpectations about the future path of monetary policy, of which the yields on Treasury securities are\nthe leading examples. In part because of the FOMC's communication strategy, which has linked the\nfuture stance of policy to the level of inflation and the extent of slack in resource utilization, market\ninterest rates have generally responded continuously and in a stabilizing manner to economic\ndevelopments.\nThe March employment report, which cited an unexpectedly high rate of job creation, provides a\nrecent example. Treasury yields rose sharply on its release as market participants traced out the\nreport's presumed implications for monetary policy. Mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, and other\nyields and asset prices moved in sympathy, with important effects on the cost of borrowing and hence,\npresumably, on aggregate demand. For practical purposes, therefore, monetary conditions tightened\nsignificantly the day of the March employment report, notwithstanding the fact that the federal funds\nrate itself was unchanged. This episode illustrates both the power and the importance of clear\ncommunication by monetary policymakers about their objectives and their evaluation of economic\nconditions.\nWith respect to future decisions about the policy rate, for me two considerations are most relevant:\nfirst, the degree of confidence one can place in the sustainability of the economic expansion and,\nsecond, the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.\nAs I have indicated, the economic expansion is showing increasing signs of being both strong and\nself-sustaining. However, to my mind, some uncertainty about that sustainability remains, arising\nprimarily from the slow recovery of the labor market. Indeed, if one takes into account the long delay\nbetween the official recession trough and the trough in employment, the labor market today remains at\nwhat effectively is an early stage of its normal cyclical expansion. Although the recent improvement in\nemployment is encouraging, from the data in hand it is not yet clear that employers have overcome\ntheir reluctance to hire at a normal pace. Additional confirmation that the recovery in the job market is\nboth sustainable and quickening would be most welcome.\nRegarding inflation, as I noted earlier, the economic fundamentals appear consistent with core\ninflation's remaining under control, in the general range of 1 to 2 percent. In particular, I see no\nindication that the U.S. economy is in imminent danger of overheating, productivity growth is keeping\nthe lid on labor costs, and the effects on inflation of the increases in commodity prices and the decline\nin the dollar to date, which are likely to be small in any event, may well have dissipated a year from\nnow. As I have acknowledged, however, there are risks to my relatively sanguine inflation forecast. In\nparticular, a rise in the public's expectations of inflation, whether \"justified\" by underlying forces or not,\nmay put upward pressure on the actual rate of inflation. Moreover, expectations of inflation can\nthemselves be destabilizing, as when an \"inflation scare\" in the bond market inappropriately raises\nlong-term yields, with adverse effects for the real economy. To avoid instability in expected inflation,\nand the volatility in actual inflation, output, and employment that might result, I believe that the Federal\nReserve should maintain at all costs its hard-won credibility for keeping the inflation rate low and\nstable. That involves, at a minimum, formulating policy with a close eye to indicators of inflation and\ninflation expectations. More generally, as I have suggested in earlier talks, I believe that the FOMC's\ncredibility and clarity would be enhanced if it announced the inflation range with which it would be\ncomfortable in the medium term (Bernanke, 2003a, 2003b). In particular, policy would be both more\ncoherent and more predictable if FOMC members shared an explicit common objective for inflation at\nthe medium-term horizon.\nTo conclude, monetary policy is now in a transition phase. That short-term interest rates must\neventually be normalized is a given. However, the remaining uncertainty about the likely paths of both\nemployment and inflation of necessity implies that the timing of policy changes at this point also\nremains uncertain. Like my colleagues on the FOMC, I will continue to watch the relevant data very\nclosely. The challenge that lies before the Committee is to manage policy in a way that permits the\neconomy to realize its productive potential while simultaneously maintaining firm control of inflation\nand inflation expectations.",

         "Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Global imbalances\nRemarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal\nReserve System, at the European Institute Roundtable on Financial and Monetary Affairs,\nWashington, DC, 23 April 2004.\n* * *\nI am pleased to participate in a discussion with such distinguished colleagues and to share my\nthoughts about some key issues confronting economic policy makers. As you are all well aware, the\nglobal economy is becoming ever more tightly knit, with national economies increasingly drawn\ntogether through trade and financial market transactions - all facilitated by continuing advances in\ntelecommunications and related technologies. The economic slowdown that the U.S. economy entered\nin 2001 was shared by Europe, East Asia, and Latin America. Similarly, the revival in growth that our\neconomy has enjoyed since the middle of last year has also shown up, to greater and lesser degrees,\nin other parts of the world.\nAlthough growth rates in different regions of the global economy are somewhat synchronous, such\nshared movements in output do not ensure that external deficits or surpluses will remain small. With\nthe United States now running a current account deficit equal to about 5 percent of the gross domestic\nproduct, the rest of the world must run a correspondingly large net current account surplus. And when\nthe U.S. deficit starts to decline, then trade flows abroad will adjust as well, reducing their overall\nsurplus.\nBecause of its size and persistence, as well as recent declines in the value of the dollar, the U.S.\ncurrent account balance is receiving an extraordinary amount of attention at present. Observers\nroutinely ask the following questions: Is the deficit unusually, or even abnormally, large? How long can\nit be sustained? How might a correction of the deficit affect the United States and its trading partners,\nincluding Europe? One must always be mindful of the possibility that the inevitable adjustment process\nrelated to global imbalances may be disorderly, but the tone of these questions is often more\npessimistic than I think is warranted. Nevertheless, these questions are important, and I will devote the\nremainder of my remarks to addressing them.\nIs the U.S. current account deficit \"abnormal\"?\nThe economics profession has no consensus model to tell us, for a given economy, what the\nappropriate level of the current account balance is. At best, economists can agree on some general\nprinciples. I will emphasize only two. First, current account imbalances allow countries to smooth\nconsumption over time, for example, in response to the ups and downs of the world price of a major\nexport. Second, current account imbalances - which represent the difference between domestic\nsavings and domestic investment - allow savings to be allocated to those parts of the world where they\ncan be invested most productively.\nOn the basis of these considerations, some analysts have argued that industrial countries should run\ncurrent account surpluses and invest their abundant savings in developing countries, which, being\nlabor-rich and capital-poor, would offer higher rates of return. However, examples of high or persistent\ncurrent account deficits abound among industrialized economies, including Canada (averaging\n2.5 percent of GDP from 1975 through 1998), the United Kingdom (1.9 percent of GDP from 1984\nthrough 2003), and Australia (4.1 percent of GDP from 1974 through 2003). Global investors have\nconfidence that in countries such as these as well as in the United States they can safely seek the\nhighest possible return for their funds.\nSome of the factors that lie behind such confidence are political stability, a legal system that effectively\nprotects property rights and enforces commercial contracts, economic policies that promote and\nstrengthen the role of markets, a financial system that efficiently channels resources to their most\nproductive uses, and an educational system that produces highly skilled workers and supports rapid\ntechnological development. These elements are present in many mature economies, including those\nof the United States and Europe.\nRates of return on investments in the United States have also been driven by the rapid diffusion of\ntechnological innovation. Labor productivity in the United States accelerated to a rate of about\n3 percent in the period 1996-2003. Over the same period, smoothing through the recent cycle, the\nvalue of U.S. equities rose about 80 percent compared with 60 percent for European equities and a\ndecline of 30 percent for Japanese. These developments attest to the expansion of favorable\ninvestment opportunities in the United States. Thus, it is neither surprising nor abnormal that,\nbeginning in the mid-1990s, capital flows to the United States - primarily in the form of direct\ninvestment and equity inflows - began to pick up substantially, including, importantly, investment flows\nfrom Europe. These capital inflows exerted upward pressure on the dollar and provided the financing\nfor our widening current account deficit.\nHow long can the current account deficit be sustained?\nTo say that a current account deficit is unsurprising or explainable is not to say that it is sustainable in\nthe long run. With the net external debt of the United States rising more rapidly than GDP, some\nnarrowing of the deficit is inevitable. However, such shrinkage does not mean that the current account\ndeficit will be eliminated. Moreover, to say that the current account deficit cannot stay large on a\npermanent basis is not to say just when or how adjustment will occur.\nOne can envision several developments that could trigger adjustment, many of which would be very\npositive for the global economy. A pickup in perceived rates of return abroad could divert capital flows\nfrom the United States to other countries and prompt adjustments in external balances. In Europe, for\nexample, a considerable expansion in the use of information technologies in recent years has not, to\ndate, appreciably boosted growth rates of labor productivity. It is conceivable that such high-tech\ninvestments may finally lead to higher productivity growth, further boosting investment spending, and\nweakening trade performance, as occurred in the United States in the 1990s. In Japan, corporate and\nfinancial sector restructuring appears to be making gains. In Latin America, improved policies and\nmore flexible exchange rates may set the stage for renewed capital inflows. And in Asia, a revival of\ndomestic demand could give the authorities confidence that, if they allow capital inflows to strengthen\ntheir currencies and narrow their current account surpluses, high rates of economic growth will be\nmaintained.\nEven if rival sources of demand for global capital do not emerge, another factor that would induce\nadjustment of the current account, if it were to occur, would be a diminishing appetite for additional\nU.S. assets and, therefore, a reduced willingness to finance the deficit. One cannot know whether or at\nwhat point such concerns might become pressing. However, by several measures, the imprint of U.S.\nfinancing needs on global capital markets has not been so large as to be problematic. At roughly\n25 percent of GDP, the net external debt of the United States is still below that of several other\nindustrial economies, including the Netherlands (30 percent), Finland (40 percent), and Australia\n(60 percent). Moreover, even though the United States has been a net debtor since 1986, the net\nincome on the international investment position has remained positive, as the rate of return on U.S.\ninvestments abroad continues to exceed that on foreign investments in the United States. From the\nstandpoint of investor portfolios, notwithstanding years of large current account deficits, the share of\nU.S. equities in global equities actually fell from 49 percent in 1997 to 47 percent in 2002; the U.S.\nshare in the global bond market moved up only marginally during the same period, from 42 percent to\n44 percent.\nFinally, current account adjustment may be prompted by increases in U.S. saving. Concerns about the\nexpanding budget deficit may prompt some reining in of fiscal policy, leading to a reduction of public\nsector dissaving. In the private sector, personal saving rates remain extremely low by historical\nstandards and thus may revert to earlier norms at some point. Either of these developments would\nboost total domestic savings and, all else being equal, cut into the current account deficit.\nAlthough we cannot know the time frame over which capital flows may begin to shift or U.S. demand\nfor imports to lessen, so far there appears to have been no loss of appetite for dollar-denominated\nassets. The dollar has declined since early 2002, but net private capital inflows have remained strong.\nIn the first two months of this year, net private foreign purchases of U.S. securities, which are\nadmittedly volatile, averaged about $60 billion, well above the $33 billion monthly pace reached in\n2001 and 2002, when the dollar was much higher. Moreover, while I am not privy to their plans, I note\nthat foreign authorities, who are increasingly large holders of dollars, currently show few signs of\nsubstantially adjusting the composition of their balance sheets.\nHow might a current account adjustment affect the U.S. and global economies?\nIf a substantial current account adjustment is required, how might it take place, and what might be its\neffects? As to the first of these questions, three mechanisms might induce a narrowing of the current\naccount deficit.\nFirst, a fall of U.S. prices below foreign prices could raise our competitiveness. Prices have become\nrelatively stable, by historical standards, in the United States and its trading partners, however, and, it\nis not clear how much of a dent this could put in the trade deficit. A second possibility is that an\nincrease of foreign growth above U.S. growth could boost our exports. Between 1970 and 1995,\nforeign GDP growth, weighted by U.S. trade, exceeded U.S. growth by nearly 2/3 percentage point\nannually; since then, U.S. growth has exceeded foreign growth by 1/4 percentage point. Thus, there is\nsome potential for foreign growth to rise relative to U.S. growth. Finally, price adjustments through\nexchange rate adjustment, by encouraging exports and making imports more costly, could play a role\nin current account adjustment.\nI must emphasize that, no matter how the U.S. external imbalance is narrowed, the level and\ncomposition of demand, both in the United States and abroad, would have to change. Such a change,\nin turn, would require adjustments of relative prices. In the United States, to accommodate increases\nin exports relative to imports, changes in relative prices would be needed to shift production toward\ninternationally traded goods and services and to shift consumption toward nontraded goods and\nservices. By the same token, adjustment by our trading partners to a reduction in the U.S. current\naccount deficit would require both an increased domestic demand to maintain the overall level of\neconomic activity and an adjustment of relative prices to raise the share of nontraded goods in\nproduction and of traded goods in consumption.\nThe prospect of a correction in the current account is often portrayed in ominous tones, a dark storm\ncloud looming on the economic horizon. Yet, the economic adjustments I have just described are both\nfeasible and, properly managed, need not lead to undue distress, either in the United States or\nabroad. After the dollar correction of the mid-1980s, for example, economic activity in the United\nStates continued to expand as the growth of domestic demand eased but was replaced by strong\ncontributions from net exports. During that period, analogous adjustments helped to maintain\neconomic performance among our trading partners. The pace of GDP growth in the foreign G7\neconomies, weighted by U.S. exports, increased from about 2-1/2 percent during 1982-84 to nearly\n4 percent in 1985-87 as greater domestic demand growth compensated for weaker performance in net\nexports.\nU.S. current account adjustment could, in fact, be associated with quite favorable scenarios for the\nglobal economy. For example, the rise in foreign productivity growth that I touched on earlier could\nwork through several channels to narrow the U.S. trade deficit as funds were attracted abroad. Strong\ndomestic demand among our trading partners would likely outweigh any drag resulting from\nappreciation of their currencies, while U.S. exports would benefit from both a change in relative prices\nand stronger foreign growth.\nOf course, the financial press frequently points to less-favorable scenarios, including the so-called\ndisorderly correction, that is, a rapid fall in the dollar that engenders a steep falloff in U.S. bond and\nequity prices and that perhaps disrupts other national markets as well. I have seen little evidence to\nsuggest that this scenario is likely, notwithstanding its popularity. The fall in the dollar since early 2002\nhas not disrupted financial markets, nor did the dollar's previous correction in the 1980s. Moreover,\nmost U.S. external debt is in dollars, so currency depreciation is unlikely to lead to the balance-sheet\nproblems that arise during financial crises in developing countries, although obviously some parties\nthat have not taken precautions would take losses.\nThat said, central bankers are paid to be prudent and watchful, and we will obviously continue to\nmonitor closely international financial markets and their effects on the U.S. economy. Looking ahead, I\nsee no obvious indications that the external sector poses significant concerns for growth or stability.\nNot only has the decline in the dollar to date failed to disrupt U.S. financial markets, but most would\njudge that, on balance, it has had only modest effects on inflation. Consumer spending is continuing to\nrise strongly and, although activity in housing markets has eased a bit, on balance, from the brisk pace\nof late last year, both sales and construction remain at high levels. In the business sector, spending on\nequipment and software appears to be increasing quite strongly, although outlays for nonresidential\nstructures have remained weak. As has been the case over the past half-year, because of sizable\nincreases in productivity, businesses seem to be able to boost production without adding much to their\npayrolls. Going forward, policy makers will have to determine whether the improvements signaled in\nsome recent labor market measures indicate that the economy is on a sustainable path to closing the\npool of underutilized resources. Although it has depressed job creation in the short run, increasing\nproductivity is positive for the economy's long-run outlook and the creation of wealth. Due, in part, to\nthese same increases in productivity, inflationary pressures have generally been muted. Now the\nprocess of disinflation appears to have ceased, and inflation has apparently stabilized. However, we\ncannot be complacent regarding inflation and inflation expectations. Should the Federal Reserve\nconclude that the maintenance of price stability is in jeopardy, I am confident that it will act\nappropriately.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, a change in the tone of international financial markets that required a substantial\nadjustment of the U.S. current account would obviously have important implications for spending and\neconomic activity, both here and abroad. However, such adjustment, properly handled, need not derail\nthe global economy nor cloud the bright prospects that the United States and Europe - linked by\nmyriad ties of commerce, communications, culture, and political tradition - share.",

         "Susan Schmidt Bies: Current issues in corporate governance\nRemarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Bank Administration Institute's Fiduciary Risk Management Conference 2004, Las\nVegas, Nevada, 26 April 2004.\n* * *\nIntroduction\nGood morning. Thank you for the invitation to open the Bank Administration Institute's important and\ntimely conference on audit, compliance, and e-security. Today, I will share some of my views on\neffective corporate governance and risk management with a special focus on certain aspects of the\ncurrent risk environment. I will also talk about the role of internal auditing in both the enterprisewide\nrisk-management environment and the new world of the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard's standards. Finally, I will mention two current accounting and reporting developments.\nCorporate governance\nEvents at some corporations over the past three years have called into question the effectiveness of\noperational, financial reporting, and compliance controls; corporate governance practices; and the\nprofessionalism of auditors. Governance issues have also been raised concerning securities\nunderwriting, bank lending practices, mutual funds, and a major stock exchange. Revelations of\nsignificant corporate governance and accounting failures, with Parmalat and Shell serving as recent\nexamples, demonstrate that these are serious concerns worldwide, not just here in the United States.\nEvents at the international level have renewed the resolve of companies around the globe to\nimplement high-quality corporate governance practices and accounting and disclosure standards, and\nfor auditors to employ rigorous and sound auditing techniques.\nInternal control fundamentals and enterprise risk management\nWhen we talk about corporate governance, we typically start at the top of the organization, with the\nboard of directors and senior management, and work downward. We do this for good reason. The\ndirectors and senior management set the governance tone within organizations and lead the way. It's\napparent that boards of directors and senior management have a very full plate these days. They must\nassess the quality of corporate governance within their organization and ensure that the firm has\neffective accounting practices, internal controls, and audit functions. They must respond to the new\nrequirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. They must establish more stringent anti-money-laundering\nprograms and comply with the USA Patriot Act. Some large financial institutions must address issues\nrelating to Basel II and the implementation work that needs to be done. Firms are considering how\nthey can be more effective in managing the business risks they face, including the rise in operational\nrisks due to increased reliance on technology and homeland security issues. And, of course, they must\nstill find the time and resources to run their businesses profitably.\nThe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) Internal Control Integrated Framework is still the\nU.S. standard on internal controls.1 The COSO model serves as the basis for meeting the internal\ncontrol assessment and reporting requirements for depository institutions laid out in section 112 of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA 112). This model is also broadly\napplicable to public companies in complying with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nUnder COSO, directors have responsibility for overseeing internal control processes so that they can\nreasonably expect that their directives will be followed. Although directors are not expected to\nunderstand the nuances of every line of business or to oversee every transaction, they are responsible\nfor setting the tone regarding their corporations' risk-taking and for establishing an effective monitoring\nprogram. The implication is that directors should be vigilant in maintaining a clear understanding of\nhow COSO is being implemented in their organizations.\nDirectors should also keep up with innovations in corporate governance. For example, directors should\nbe aware that a new COSO framework has been proposed to encompass Enterprise Risk\nManagement.2 A draft of the updated COSO framework was released for comment last summer, and a\nfinal document is expected later this year.\nFor those of you not familiar with the new COSO framework, let me briefly explain that enterprisewide\nrisk management is a discipline that an organization can use to identify events that may affect its\nability to achieve its strategic goals and to manage its activities consistent with its risk appetite. Such\nevents include not only those that may result in adverse outcomes, but also those that give rise to\nopportunities. When embraced, an enterprisewide risk management framework improves the quality\nand flow of information for decisionmakers and stakeholders, focuses attention on the achievement of\norganizational goals, and improves the overall governance of an organization.\nSome key steps in effective enterprisewide risk management include identifying and assessing the key\nrisks within an organization and determining the appropriate response to those risks. Companies\nshould determine the level of risk they are willing to accept given the return they can achieve.\nManagement then must implement effective processes to limit risk to the acceptable level. Once these\nsteps have been taken, business line managers are expected to monitor actual risk levels and test the\neffectiveness of the risk responses.\nSeveral elements are essential to the successful implementation of enterprisewide risk management.\nOne is clearly articulated risk-management goals which provide a foundation for the enterprisewide\nrisk management program and for related training and communication. A second is a common risk\nlanguage which is critical because it enables individuals throughout the organization to conduct\nmeaningful cross-functional discussions about risk. A third element essential to the implementation of\nsuccessful enterprisewide risk management is that individuals clearly understand their roles in the\nrisk-assessment and risk-management framework. In today's environment, all organizations should\nconsider embracing this discipline. Indeed, the Federal Reserve is currently considering how\nenterprisewide risk management can better be integrated into its management processes.\nTone at the top\nIt is also important that a strong culture of compliance be established at the top of the organization and\nthat a proper ethical tone be set for governing the conduct of business. In many instances, senior\nmanagement must move from thinking about compliance as chiefly a cost center to considering the\nbenefits of compliance in protecting against legal and reputational risks that can have an impact on the\nbottom line. The board and senior management are obligated to deliver a strong message to others in\nthe firm about the importance of integrity, compliance with the law, fair treatment of customers, and\noverall good business ethics. Leaders should demonstrate their commitment through their individual\nconduct and their response to control failures.\nWhile the ethical tone of a financial institution comes from the top, a successful ethics program must\nbe demonstrated by staff at all levels and throughout the organization. The environment should\nempower any employee to elevate ethical or reputational concerns to appropriate levels of\nmanagement without fear of retribution. In other words, the culture of the organization should raise\nissues to senior management that they may not be aware of; management can then demonstrate their\ncommitment by responding appropriately.\nRole of internal audit\nThis leads me to the importance of the role of the internal audit function within an organization. The\nFederal Reserve is very supportive of an independent audit function at financial services companies.\nAs indicated in our amended interagency policy statement released last year, the audit committee\nshould provide for an independent, objective, and professional internal audit process.3 The audit\ncommittee must set the tone for the internal audit function.\nTo support this goal, the audit committee should ensure that internal audit has an effective quality\nassurance process. This becomes increasingly important as organizations grow in scale, enter new\nlines of business, become more complex, or acquire organizations with different cultures. As\norganizations grow, internal auditors must learn new technical skills, manage larger staffs, and be\ncontinually alert for emerging gaps or conflicts of interest in the system of internal controls. This often\nrequires that the quality assurance process around the internal audit process become better defined\nand alerts the general auditor and the audit committee to weaknesses in the internal audit program\npromptly.\nRisk-focused audit programs should be reviewed regularly to ensure that audit resources are focused\non the higher-risk areas as the company grows and produces and as processes change. As lower-risk\nareas come up for review, auditors should do enough transaction testing to be confident in their risk\nrating. Audit committees should receive reports on all breaks in internal controls in a form that will help\nthem determine where the controls and the auditing process can be strengthened.\nBefore a company moves into new or higher-risk areas, the board of directors and senior management\nshould receive assurances from appropriate management and internal audit that the tools and metrics\nare in place to ensure that the basics of sound governance will be adhered to. The audit committee\nshould actively engage the internal auditor to ensure that the bank's risk assessment and control\nprocess are vigorous.\nMany of the organizations that have seen their reputations tarnished in the past few years have simply\nneglected to consider emerging conflicts of interest when adding new products and lines of business.\nIt is important to make sure that appropriate firewalls and mitigating controls are in place before the\nproduct or activity begins.\nThe audit committee should also require the highest possible level of independence for the internal\naudit process and eliminate any threats to this independence, such as the tendency for some internal\nauditors to act as management consultants within the organization. Internal auditors add value by\nbeing effective independent assessors of the quality of the internal control framework and processes.\nAuditors lose their independence when they perform management consulting roles for which they later\nwill have to render an opinion. Internal audit is one of the few corporate functions with both the ability\nand the responsibility to look across all of the management silos within the corporation and make sure\nthat the system of internal controls has no gaps and that the control framework is continually reviewed\nto keep up with corporate strategic initiatives, reorganizations, and process changes. When an auditor\nbecomes part of the management process subject to internal audit review, the independent view is\nlost.\nI would also like to add that internal auditors are the eyes and ears of the audit committee around the\norganization. As the complexity of financial products and technology has grown, the financial services\nindustry has increased its reliance on vendors and third-party service providers for a host of\ntechnological solutions. Be mindful that these outsourcing arrangements may pose additional types of\nrisks for the organization, such as security or data privacy risks. Internal auditors should remain\nvigilant in identifying risks as the organization changes or new products are delivered to the\nmarketplace.\nThe U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\nWhile we are discussing the importance of effective internal controls, let me point out that the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) has recently approved Auditing Standard No. 2, An\nAudit of Internal Control over Financial Reporting Performed in Conjunction with an Audit of Financial\nStatements.4 The new standard is clearly an improvement over the previous one. It highlights the\nbenefits of strong internal controls over financial reporting and furthers the objectives of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act. This standard requires external auditors of public companies to evaluate the\nprocess that management uses to prepare the company's financial statements. External auditors must\ngather evidence regarding the design and operations effectiveness of the company's internal controls\nand determine whether evidence supports management's assessment of the effectiveness of the\ncompany's internal controls. While the new standard allows external auditors to use the work of others,\nincluding that performed by internal auditors, it emphasizes that external auditors must perform\nenough of the testing themselves so that their own work provides the principal evidence for making a\ndetermination regarding the company's controls. Based on the work performed, the external auditor\nmust render an opinion as to whether the company's internal control process is effective, which is a\nrelatively high standard.\nIn addition, as part of its overall assessment of internal controls, the external auditor is expected to\nevaluate the effectiveness of the audit committee. If the audit committee is deemed to be ineffective,\nthe external auditor is required to report that assessment to the company's board of directors.\nThis new standard will certainly put more demands on external auditors and public companies alike.\nBut this is the price to be paid for \"raising the bar\" to achieve greater reliability in corporate financial\nstatements and to regain the confidence of the public and the trust of financial markets.\nRisk management in the e-commerce environment\nLet's now turn our focus to risk management in today's e-commerce environment. We know that an\nimportant component of risk management involves monitoring and managing environmental and\nexternal risks. This is an area in which business and operations risk are increasing. Over the past few\nyears, the global community has experienced a series of \"cyberincidents\" - primarily in the form of\nincreasingly virulent viruses and worms, and some hacking incidents have involved company insiders.\nThe extensive electric power outages experienced by a large section of the United States and parts of\nCanada last August, along with collateral effects involving the telecommunication, transportation, and\nwater sectors, further underscore the need for financial institutions to integrate the risk of a wide-scale\ndisruption into their risk- management strategies.\nLet me say at the outset that the financial sector has performed extraordinarily well in responding to\nthese incidents. Moreover, we are extremely proud that financial markets and participants have been\nable to meet these challenges and continue critical operations without any systemic effects or loss of\nconfidence in our financial system. This is no accident. Financial institutions have increasingly devoted\nresources to addressing operations risk, business continuity, security (physical and cyber), and\ninformation-sharing. I would like to highlight some of the key developments we have observed and\ndiscuss where our business-risk-management efforts should be focused.\nOperations risk\nSince the mid-1990s, the concept of operations risk has received increasing attention in connection\nwith the evolution of enterprise risk management. By \"operations risk\" I mean any risk that arises from\ninadequate or failed internal processes, people, or systems or from external events. Examples of\noperations risk include employee fraud, failed information system conversions, missent wires, and\nweaknesses in security procedures for protecting assets and information.\nIn February 2003, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released a paper titled \"Sound\nPractices for the Management and Supervision of Operational Risk\" that outlines a set of broad\nprinciples that should govern the management of operational risk at depository institutions of all sizes.5\nThese principles will likely play a key role in shaping our ongoing supervisory efforts in the United\nStates with regard to operations risk management. As with COSO's enterprise risk management\nframework, I encourage you to read the operations risk paper.\nOperations risk has always been a part of banking. But the increasing complexity of financial\norganizations, an increase in the number and variety of products and services they provide, the\nevolution of business processes (including substantially greater reliance on information technology\nand telecommunications), and changes in the ethical environment in which we live have all contributed\nto more observable exposures to this type of risk. Many of the community bank failures in recent years\nhave been due to operations risks. In a few cases, dominant chief executives perpetrated fraud by\nmanipulating the internal controls. In others, the management information systems necessary to\nmonitor exposures in riskier lines of business were never built. As a result, other managers and the\nboards of directors did not have the information necessary to monitor and understand the growing\nrisks inherent in what appeared to be profitable strategies.\nOperations risk was a primary focus of Y2K preparations a few years ago. Identification of critical\ncomputer-reliant systems and infrastructures gave us a much clearer understanding of the financial\nsystem's dependence on technology and of the complexities of managing operations risk. Once\ninstitutions understood the considerable business risks that would result if they could not serve\ncustomers, they moved the management of Y2K preparations out of the back office and onto the\ndesks of product-line and senior managers - where it belongs.\nMoreover, it became clear that financial institutions needed to plan for the possibility that an external\nthreat - a failure in the critical infrastructure or by a major service provider or material counterparty -\nmight severely impact a financial institution's business operations. There was an increased\nunderstanding of the interdependencies across market participants and of how credit, liquidity, and\noperations risks at one organization could have a cascading impact on other financial institutions.\nIT and physical security\nAs a former banker, I can attest to the fact that banking organizations have long understood the need\nfor strong internal IT controls and physical security. The trust and confidence consumers have that\ntheir assets and confidential information are completely secure is a pillar of the U.S. financial system.\nThe increasing role of information system networks and the Internet in business operations as a\nmeans of conducting business with customers has engendered new cybersecurity risks for financial\ninstitutions. Thankfully, banking organizations recognized these risks from the outset and became\nleaders in addressing cyberprotection issues. For example, financial services was the first private\nsector to incorporate encryption into business processes on a wide scale. Nevertheless, each year the\ncontinuous stream of cyberattacks, such as the Bugbear.B virus (which targeted banks) and the\nSoBig.F worm, demonstrate that cybersecurity will need to be an ongoing battle. Experience to date\nshows that banking organizations are effectively managing cybersecurity risk. There have been\nrelatively few serious intrusions, and there have been virtually no disruptions of critical systems.\nNevertheless, financial institutions can expect to remain a target of cyberattacks. I believe there is a\nneed for heightened attention to managing this risk. This includes monitoring warnings carefully, acting\nquickly to apply patches in a controlled environment, and taking other steps necessary to preclude any\ndamage to information systems.\nMoreover, I urge you to review your internal security requirements to make sure that effective controls\nare in place and being followed. You may recall that my definition of operations risk includes employee\nfraud. We are still seeing evidence that most successful - or nearly successful - hacking incidents can\nbe traced back to current or former employees.\nWe regulators have been mindful of the tremendous growth in your reliance on information technology,\nsuch as the shift from mainframe computing to the use of distributed systems and the Internet,\nincreased reliance on commercial off-the-shelf software, and a general expansion of potential external\naccess to enterprise data. This increase in operations risk raises significant safety and soundness\nconcerns for financial institutions and privacy concerns for consumers. In January 2003, the FFIEC\n(Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council) issued revised guidance for examiners and\nfinancial institutions to use in identifying information security risks and evaluating the adequacy of\ncontrols and applicable risk-management practices.6 The guidance, contained in the Information\nSecurity Booklet, describes how an institution should protect and secure the systems and facilities that\nprocess and maintain information. It calls on financial institutions and technology service providers to\nmaintain effective security programs that are tailored to the complexity of their operations. Several\nyears ago, as part of the shift to a risk-focused approach to supervision, the Federal Reserve\nintegrated information technology reviews into safety and soundness examinations. This assures that\nour evolving understanding of the elements of operations risk is reflected in supervisory assessments\nof the adequacy of risk management across the entire enterprise. I hope that you are already familiar\nwith the supervisory expectations in the Information Security Booklet.\nI would also like to remind everyone of the importance of securing customer information. This privacy\nrequirement goes beyond the IT systems themselves to the output of those systems. Distributed\nprocessing means paper copies of customer information tend to proliferate. Information security\nshould include protection of paper documents, including their safe disposal, so that customers' private\ninformation does not inadvertently fall into the wrong hands.\nOn the physical security side, I am aware that some of you have had to step up physical security\nprotocols to ensure that your facilities and staff are protected. Over the past year, we have had several\noccasions when the government raised the threat level to Orange (High). Responding responsibly to\nphysical threat warnings is costly and can be confusing, but it cannot be avoided. The Department of\nHomeland Security has provided some general guidelines on how to adjust security measures to its\nthreat-level warning system. Industry groups have been sharing information on the measures they\nplan to take at various threat levels - including measures to protect staff by conducting operations from\nhomes or back-up locations. This discussion has led to a greater awareness and commitment by\nfinancial institutions to ensure that all practical measures are taken to protect employees and facilities.\nI commend the industry for the work it has done in responding to homeland security issues. I hope you\nwill continue to share information on ways to protect your businesses in the post-September 11\nenvironment. I also suggest that you make every effort to coordinate with local protection authorities\nso that they are aware of your special needs and you understand their emergency protocols.\nAllowance for loan and lease losses\nFinally, I want to talk about two accounting and reporting issues. Financial regulators want to\nencourage banking organizations to strengthen their processes and documentation associated with\ntheir determination of the adequacy of their allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL). As you know,\naccounting standardsetters recently questioned the methodology for loan loss reserves and proposed\nnew guidance. The good news is that they now recognize that reaffirming existing guidance could\naddress many of the questions raised. But the fact that loan loss reserve methodology is a recurring\nissue reflects the reality that concerns about how the ALLL is being estimated and its impact on\nearnings do arise from time to time. In general, these situations can be addressed through\nstrengthened audit procedures rather than changes in accounting standards. Furthermore,\nmanagement of financial institutions should be reminded to take the time to review the estimation\nprocedures for determining their loan-loss reserves.\nBanking institutions should be applying an ALLL methodology that is well defined, consistently applied,\nand auditable. Institutions are required to maintain written documentation to support the amounts of\nthe ALLL and the provision for loan and lease losses reported in the financial statements. This\nmethodology should be validated periodically and should be modified to incorporate new events or\nfindings as needed. Interagency supervisory guidance specifies that management, under the direction\nof the board of directors, should implement appropriate procedures and controls to ensure compliance\nwith the institution's ALLL policies and procedures. Given that many banks use credit models, it is\nimportant that those models be validated periodically. Institutions should be vigilant to ensure the\nintegrity of their credit-related data and that the loan review process provides the most up-to-date and\naccurate information possible for management to consider as part of its ALLL assessment.\nCall report modernization\nI also want to mention that the federal banking agencies are using advances in technology in their own\nbusiness practices. One example is a project that is currently under way to improve the collection,\nvalidation, distribution, and use of the Call Report data that is submitted by banks to the banking\nagencies. This effort is referred to as the Call Report Modernization Initiative. Under the sponsorship\nof the FFIEC, the banking agencies are developing a central data repository to be a shared resource\nfor all those who provide Call Report data or rely on these data in their business. A primary goal of the\nproject is to allow for faster validation of the Call Report data, which will ultimately allow for faster\nrelease of these data to the public. This project has been under way for a couple of years now and is\nscheduled to go \"live\" in September 2004. You can find more information about the Call Report\nmodernization project on the FFIEC web site (www.ffiec.gov/find/).\nThe Federal Reserve is also making improvements in the reporting process for bank holding\ncompanies (BHCs). All BHCs are now required to file the Y-9 financial reports electronically, thereby\neliminating paper-copy reporting. In addition, similar to the Call Report modernization effort that has\nbeen undertaken on an interagency basis, the Federal Reserve will be implementing a process that\nmore quickly validates the BHC Y-9 data so that the data are released faster to the public. You can\ncontact your district Federal Reserve Bank if you would like additional information on this initiative.\nInformation is also available on a Federal Reserve web site (www.reportingandreserves.org/).\nConclusion\nI have touched on a number of important topics today. While some of them, such as loan loss reserve\naccounting, cybersecurity, and corporate ethics, are rather specific, these risk issues cannot be\nviewed in isolation. I want to note that these are just aspects of the broader issues of corporate\ngovernance and enterprisewide risk management. Successful risk management is integrated into an\norganization's corporate governance processes, with appropriate controls, testing, and oversight.\nBoards of directors and senior management have the responsibility to establish effective\nrisk-management and assessment processes across their organizations and to integrate the results of\nthose efforts into their strategic and operating planning processes. The internal audit function can play\nan important role in reviewing the quality of corporate governance, internal control, and enterprisewide\nrisk management because of its unique, firmwide perspective and its independence.",

         "Susan Schmidt Bies: Innovation in financial markets and banking relationships\nSpeech by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Financial Executives International 2004 Summit, San Diego, California, 27 April 2004.\n* * *\nI am very pleased to be here for the Financial Executives International 2004 Summit. As many of you\nknow, before my appointment to the Board of Governors, I was quite active in this organization,\nparticularly on the Committee on Corporate Reporting. I also served on the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force. Now, as a member of the Federal Reserve Board,\nand Chair of the Board's Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Affairs, I find myself focusing on\nthe growth and evolution of the financial system from a slightly different perspective than when I was a\nchief financial officer.\nThe continuing evolution of the banking and financial markets has created opportunities both for\nproviders and for users of financial products, and this evolution has been beneficial to the economy.\nHowever, innovations in financial products also have given rise to some new challenges for market\nparticipants and their supervisors in the areas of corporate governance and compliance. The events of\nthe past three years demonstrate again that fraudulent conduct and weak corporate governance at a\nfew firms can dramatically change the cost of capital and impose additional regulatory burden on even\nwell-managed organizations.\nWhen similar events occurred in the 1980s, FEI, one of the five members of the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission, took the lead in defining best\npractices for internal controls. FEI should be proud that the COSO Internal Control Framework was the\nbasis of much of the internal control mandates of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and still is seen as the\nseminal work in its field. Fundamental elements of corporate governance and compliance naturally\nbecome more challenging as activities become more complex. The major breaks in the internal\ncontrols of corporations in the past few years, and the role of bankers in those events, has led bank\nregulators to change their view of bankers' relationships with their corporate clients. Today, I'd like to\ntouch on some of these challenges and on how financial institutions and their corporate customers can\nadopt new ways of working together. I am going to talk about some new regulatory guidance on\ncomplex structured finance transactions and guidance on industry best practice regarding credit risk\ntransfer instruments. I also want to speak about an issue that is confusing to many companies:\nantitying regulation as it relates to services provided by banking organizations.\nBut before I talk about these issues, I would like to step back and discuss some broader, longer-term\nissues that affect accounting and corporate governance. Looking beyond the isolated cases of outright\nfraud, I believe a fundamental problem is this: As organizations have grown in size and scope,\ninnovative financing techniques have made it more difficult for outside investors to understand a\nparticular firm's risk profile and the performance of its various lines of business. Traditional accounting\nstandards have not kept pace with the risk-management tools employed by sophisticated corporations.\nThus, more meaningful disclosure of firms' risk-management positions and strategies is crucial for\nimproving corporate transparency for market participants.\nFinancial innovations and disclosure\nOver the past few decades, firms have acquired effective new tools with which to manage financial\nrisk. For example, securitization helps a firm manage the risk of a concentrated exposure by\ntransferring some of that exposure outside the firm. By pooling assets and issuing marketable\nsecurities, firms obtain liquidity and reduce funding costs. Of course, moving assets off the balance\nsheet and into special purpose entities, with the attendant creation of servicing rights and high risk\nresidual interests retained by firms, generates its own risks and reduces transparency unless the firm\ntakes additional steps to enhance disclosure.\nSeveral types of securitization have grown rapidly over the past decade. One of the fastest growing\nhas been asset-backed commercial paper, which soared from only $16 billion outstanding at the end\nof 1989 to about $690 billion as of year-end 2003. Commercial mortgage securitizations have also\nproliferated noticeably since the early 1990s. The dollar amount of outstanding securities backed by\ncommercial and multifamily mortgages has risen from $36 billion at the end of 1989 to just under\n$450 billion as of this past September. In addition, commercial banks and finance companies have\nmoved business loans off their books through the development of collateralized debt obligations.\nSecuritized business loans amounted to $100 billion in the third quarter of 2003, up from a relatively\nminiscule $2 billion in 1989.\nFirms also use derivatives to manage their risk exposures to price fluctuations in currency, commodity,\nenergy, and interest rate markets. More recently, firms have used credit derivatives, a relatively new\ntype of derivative that allows them to purchase protection against the risk of loss from the default of a\ngiven entity. By purchasing such protection, financial and nonfinancial firms alike can reduce their\nexposures to particular borrowers or counterparties. Credit derivatives also allow financial firms to\nachieve a more diversified credit portfolio by acquiring credit exposure to borrowers with which they do\nnot have a lending relationship. For example, European insurance companies reportedly have used\ncredit derivatives to acquire exposure to European corporations that, because they rely primarily on\nbank lending, have little publicly traded debt outstanding.\nThe improvements in technology, the quick pace of financial innovation, and the evolving\nrisk-management techniques almost ensure that businesses will increasingly use almost limitless\nconfigurations of products and services and sophisticated financial structures. Accordingly, outsiders\nwill have ever more difficulty understanding the risk positions of many large, complex organizations.\nThese developments represent significant challenges to standard setters and to firms. For market\ndiscipline to be effective, accounting standards must evolve to accurately capture these developments.\nCompany managers must also do their part, by ensuring that public disclosures clearly identify all\nsignificant risk exposures - whether on or off the balance sheet - and their effects on the firm's\nfinancial condition and performance, cash flow, and earnings potential. With regard to securitizations,\nderivatives, and other innovative risk-transfer instruments, accounting measurement of a company's\nbalance sheet at a point in time is insufficient to convey the full effect of a company's financial risk\nprofile.\nOrganizations should continue to improve their enterprise-wide risk-management and reporting\nfunctions. The FEI's leadership in the proposed COSO Enterprise Risk Management Framework\ndemonstrates this organization's recognition of the importance of this new discipline. I would like to\nchallenge companies to use their new risk-management discipline as a framework also to begin\ndisclosing this information to the market, perhaps in summary form, paying due attention to the need\nfor keeping proprietary business data confidential. Disclosures would not only provide more qualitative\nand quantitative information about the firm's current risk exposure to the market but also help the\nmarket assess the quality of the risk oversight and risk appetite of the organization.\nMy last comment on disclosures is that less than fully transparent disclosures are not limited to\n\"complex\" off-balance-sheet transactions. One glaring example is the treatment of expenses\nassociated with defined-benefit pension plans. In recent years we have seen how the accounting rules\nfor these plans can produce, quite frankly, some very misleading measures of corporate earnings and\nbalance sheets. In effect, firms use expectations of the long-term return on assets in defined-benefit\nplans to calculate current-period pension costs (income). At the same time, they use a spot rate to\ndiscount the future liabilities. This accounting is reconciled with economic reality by gradual\namortization of the discrepancies between the assumed and the actual returns experienced on\npension assets. As many of you are aware, this smoothing feature can create very large distortions\nbetween economic reality and the pension-financing cost accruals embedded in the income statement.\nA recent study by Federal Reserve staff indicates that \"full disclosure\" of the underlying details, by\nitself, does not appear to be a panacea.1 The study adopts the premise that most of what investors\nneed to know about the true pension-financing costs, not the mixed-attribute accounting costs, can be\nreflected in two numbers disclosed in the pension footnote. These two numbers are the fair market\nvalue of pension assets and the present value of outstanding pension liabilities. The study finds that\nthese direct measures of pension assets and liabilities tend to be ignored by investors in favor of the\npotentially misleading accounting measures, and as a result, the average firm with a defined-benefit\nplan in 2001 may have been 5 percent to 10 percent overvalued relative to an otherwise similar firm\nwithout a defined-benefit plan.\nIn general, the test for useful disclosure should be the following questions: Are the firm and its\naccountants providing investors with what is needed to accurately evaluate the financial position of the\nfirm and the risks that it faces? And is the information provided in a manner that facilitates accurate\nassessments by investors? Ultimately, improved transparency would benefit corporations by reducing\nuncertainty about the value of their securities, which would lower the cost of, and increase access to,\nmarket funding.\nComplex structured finance transactions\nFinancial innovation also has given rise to an increase in the sophistication of complex structured\nfinance transactions. While we can hope that we are seeing the end of the corporate governance\nscandals that have plagued companies world-wide, we must remain alert to the underlying causes of\nthese scandals - inadequate corporate governance structures, compliance frameworks, and internal\ncontrols - and redouble our efforts to create a new compliance environment. This new compliance\nenvironment must address the growth in complex structured finance transactions.\nWhat do we mean by complex structured finance transactions? Although each deal can vary, complex\nstructured finance transactions generally have four common characteristics. First, they typically result\nin a final product that is often nonstandard and structured to meet the specific financial objectives of a\ncustomer. Second, they often involve professionals from multiple disciplines within the financial\ninstitution and may involve significant fees or high returns in relation to the market and credit risks\nassociated with the transaction. Third, they may be associated with the creation or use of one or more\nspecial-purpose entities designed to address the economic, legal, tax, or accounting objectives of the\ncustomer or the use of a combination of cash and derivatives products. Fourth, and perhaps most\nimportant, they may expose the financial institution to elevated levels of market, credit, operations,\nlegal, or reputational risks.\nAs we are all too aware, in the most extreme cases, complex structured finance transactions appear to\nhave been used in fraudulent schemes to misrepresent the financial condition of public companies or\nevade taxes. As a result, the corporations that engaged in these improper transactions and the\nfinancial institutions that structured and advised on these transactions have been subject to civil and\nadministrative enforcement actions. The existence of these schemes has also sparked an\ninvestigation by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on\nGovernmental Affairs, as well as numerous lawsuits by private investors.\nAlthough these events have raised serious concerns, it is important to recognize that structured\nfinance transactions and other market innovations, when used and designed appropriately, play an\nimportant role in financing corporate America. Structured finance transactions, as well as financial\nderivatives for market and credit risk, asset-backed securities with customized cash flow features, and\nspecialized financial conduits that manage pools of purchased assets, have served the legitimate\nbusiness purposes of bank customers and are an essential part of U.S. and international capital\nmarkets.\nHowever, financial institutions may assume substantial risks when they engage in these transactions\nwithout a full understanding of their economic substance and business purpose. These risks often are\ndifficult to quantify but the result can be severe damage to the reputations of the companies engaging\nin the transactions and their financial advisers, and in turn, impaired public confidence in those\ninstitutions. These potential risks and the resulting damage are particularly severe when markets react\nthrough adverse changes in pricing for similarly structured transactions that are designed\nappropriately.\nAssessments of the appropriateness of a transaction for a client traditionally have required financial\nfirms and advisers to determine if the transaction is consistent with the market sophistication, financial\ncondition, and investment policies of the customer. Given recent events, it is appropriate to raise the\nbar on appropriateness assessments by taking into account the business purpose and economic\nsubstance of the transaction. For those of you who are CFOs or other senior officials of corporations\nseeking to engage in complex structured finance transactions, you should expect to receive more\nquestions from your bankers on why you wish to engage in certain transactions, how you will account\nfor them for financial reporting and tax purposes, and how you will explain them to your shareholders\nand other stakeholders. You can expect this heightened level of inquiry because, when banking\norganizations provide advice on, arrange, or actively participate in complex structured finance\ntransactions, they may assume legal and reputational risks if the end-user enters into the transaction\nfor improper purposes.\nThe Federal Reserve has been working with the other federal banking agencies and the Securities\nand Exchange Commission to develop interagency guidance on complex structured finance\ntransactions. We believe it is important for all participants in complex structured transactions to\nunderstand the agencies' concerns and supervisory direction. Our goal is to highlight the \"lessons\nlearned\" from recent events as well as what we believe to be sound practices in this area on the basis\nof supervisory reviews and experience.\nAs in other operational areas, strong internal controls and risk management procedures can help\ninstitutions effectively manage the risks associated with complex structured finance transactions. Here\nare some of the steps that financial institutions should take to establish such controls and procedures:\n• Ensure that the institution's board of directors establishes the institution's overall appetite for\nrisk (especially reputational and legal) and effectively communicates the board's risk\ntolerances throughout the organization.\n• Implement firm-wide policies and procedures that provide for the consistent identification,\nevaluation, documentation, and management of all risks associated with complex structured\ntransactions - in particular, the credit, reputational, and legal risks.\n•\nImplement firm-wide policies and procedures that ensure that the financial institution obtains\na thorough understanding of the business purposes and economic substance of transactions\nidentified as involving heightened legal or reputational risk and that these transactions are\napproved by appropriate senior management.\n• Clearly define the framework for approval of a complex structured finance transaction or a\nnew complex structured finance product.\n•\nImplement monitoring, risk reporting, and compliance processes for creating, analyzing,\noffering, and marketing complex structured finance products.\nOf course, these internal controls need to be supported and enforced by a strong \"tone at the top\" and\na firm-wide culture of compliance.\nAs a result of recent public and supervisory attention to complex structured finance transactions, we\nexpect that banks will be asking more questions, requesting additional documentation, and scrutinizing\nfinancial statements more carefully to guard against reputational and legal risk. For example, for\ntransactions identified as involving heightened risks, we expect that the bank's staff would obtain and\ndocument, before approval of the transaction, complete and accurate information about the customer's\nproposed accounting treatment of the transaction, financial disclosures relating to the transaction, and\nthe customer's objectives for entering into the transaction. This enhanced due diligence may appear to\nimpose some documentation burdens on the corporate customers of banking organizations, but this\ninformation should be substantially similar to the information that corporate customers are providing to\ntheir own senior management and boards of directors as part of their own internal review and approval\nprocess for complex structured finance transactions.\nOur supervisory reviews indicate that many financial institutions have already taken steps to enhance\ntheir internal controls and due-diligence processes in order to filter out transactions with unacceptable\nlevels of reputational and legal risk. As a result, some financial institutions have turned down deals\nwith unfavorable risk characteristics that they may have accepted in the past. While we applaud these\ndevelopments, we hope that the guidance we are developing will help further improve the awareness,\namong both banking organizations and their corporate customers, of sound practices in this area.\nCredit risk transfer and conflicts of interest\nFinancial market innovation and the development of increasingly complex structures for credit risk\ntransfer also may give rise to legal or reputational risk. In recent years, we have seen considerable\nadvances in the management and transfer of credit risk, including credit default swaps and\ncollateralized debt obligations. These practices and the development of new and more liquid markets\nhave come about because of better risk measurement techniques. They have the potential, I believe,\nto substantially improve the efficiency of world financial markets through the diversification benefits\nthat credit risk transfer mechanisms can provide. However, the fundamental elements of risk\nmanagement must be kept firmly in mind if these innovations are to succeed.\nBy their design, credit risk transfer instruments segment risk for distribution to the parties most willing\nto accept them. A key point, however, is that market participants must be able to recognize and\nunderstand the risks underlying the instruments they trade and be able to successfully absorb and\ndiffuse any subsequent loss. Another consideration is whether one party to the transaction is entering\ninto the trade with an unfair advantage by virtue of its role as a lender to the same or a related entity.\nFinancial firms that have large corporate loan portfolios increasingly have accessed the credit\nderivatives market to help them manage their risk while continuing to extend credit to corporate\ncustomers. While this development has created market efficiencies and investment opportunities,\nthese positive factors have been somewhat overshadowed by concerns that some credit market\nparticipants who receive material nonpublic information in the ordinary course of their normal business\nactivities may need to better control access to that information. Specifically, access to material\nnonpublic information needs to be walled off from personnel who conduct securities and derivatives\ntrading.\nThe potential for conflicts of interest between loan origination and credit derivatives trading activities\nhas been recognized by the industry as well as regulators, and that is a commendable development.\nIn October 2003, the Joint Market Practices Forum, a collaborative effort of the Bond Market\nAssociation, the International Association of Credit Portfolio Managers, the International Swaps and\nStatement of\nDerivatives Association, and the Loan Syndications and Trading Association, issued a\nPrinciples and Recommendations Regarding the Handling of Material Nonpublic Information by Credit\nMarket\nParticipants. The statement articulates principles and recommendations regarding the handling\nand use of material nonpublic information by credit market participants that maintain loan portfolios or\nengage in other activities that generate credit exposures and, in that connection, enter into\ntransactions in securities or security-based swaps, including certain credit derivatives.\nThe statement of principles fulfills a number of objectives. The most critical, in my view, is the\npromotion of fair and competitive markets in which the inappropriate use of material nonpublic\ninformation is not tolerated. At the same time, the statement allows lenders to effectively manage\ncredit portfolio activities to facilitate borrower access to more-liquid and more-efficient sources of\ncredit. This effort recognizes that the liquidity and efficiency of our financial markets are related directly\nto the integrity of, and public confidence in, those markets.\nThe joint statement describes two models of credit portfolio management: the \"private side\" model and\nthe \"public side\" model. In reality, most banking organizations appear to have adopted a hybrid model\nthat lies at some point along a continuum between pure private and pure public.\nIn general, in a private-side model, credit derivatives traders may have access to material nonpublic\ninformation, but traders must pre-clear each transaction they execute. In a public-side model, traders\nare walled off from private-side information and personnel to prevent their access to material nonpublic\ninformation. Accordingly, the circumstances in which a transaction is restricted because of the trader's\npossession of material nonpublic information is limited.\nThe forum's statement of principles also provides several meaningful recommendations, some of\nwhich already have been adopted by the major participants in the credit derivatives markets. Among\nother things, the recommendations call for market participants to have in place policies and\nprocedures for handling material nonpublic information, internal controls, an independent compliance\nfunction, recordkeeping requirements, and training programs. Additional specific recommendations are\nadvanced for credit portfolio management activities conducted from the private side and from the\npublic side.\nAt a recent Bond Market Association conference, attendees noted that the principles contained in the\nstatement generally are workable. However, questions of interpretation do arise under the statement\nand can be expected to continue to arise as the market develops additional innovations in credit\nportfolio management.\nQuestions of interpretation may arise in determining whether and to what extent information is public\nor private, especially for organizations operating in global markets. Does material nonpublic\ninformation on one name in an index fund taint the entire index? Are the bank's internal ratings or\nchanges in internal ratings private information? Issues of \"signaling\" private information also arise\nwhen public-side traders become aware of transactions entered into on the private side. That is, to\nwhat extent can traders infer material nonpublic information through action (or inaction) in private-side\nbusiness lines?\nLast, but certainly not least, information may be confidential or proprietary even if it does not rise to the\nlevel of material nonpublic information. The misuse of confidential or proprietary information that is not\nmaterial nonpublic information may not give rise to securities law violations, but it may give rise to\ncommon law claims.\nThe statement and recommendations of the Joint Market Practices Forum brings to light important\npotential conflicts of interest in credit derivatives trading and helps to identify issues that may arise in\nconnection with credit portfolio management. The statement and recommendations provide guidance\non credit portfolio management for financial institutions that may be new to the derivatives markets\nand provide a catalyst to further improvements in the risk management environment. Credit risk\ntransfer is still a relatively young market, and attention to issues such as these should help participants\ndevelop confidence in both the new instruments and markets that will lead to more liquid and reliable\ntransactions.\nAnti-tying restrictions on banks\nFinally, I want to discuss the nature of anti-tying regulations for financial institutions, an issue that can\nbe very confusing to nonbankers. As innovations create new financial instruments, services, and\nmarkets, and as firms expand the scope of the types of financial services they offer, the\nbusiness-decision process is similar to that which many of you apply in your own business. Financial\ninstitutions are trying to build customer loyalty by offering a broader menu of financial services to\ncorporate customers. The concern addressed by anti-tying restrictions is that banks may force\ncustomers to take unwanted products to obtain needed services.\nThe Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking agencies have long required that banking\norganizations establish and maintain policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the anti-tying\nrestrictions, and the agencies monitor these policies and procedures through the supervisory process.\nIn addition, more-targeted examinations may be conducted to review marketing programs, training\nmaterials, internal risk management reports, internal audits, and any internal investigations.\nIn 2002 and 2003, the federal banking agencies received a number of inquiries concerning the scope,\neffectiveness, and impact of the anti-tying restrictions on banks. Some of these inquiries suggested\nthat commercial banks were unfairly competing for investment banking business by tying the provision\nof bank credit to investment banking business. In this connection, a March 2003 survey by the\nAssociation of Financial Professionals indicated that 24 percent of the 218 large corporate\nrespondents to the survey had been told explicitly by a commercial bank that the company had been\ndenied credit or had been extended credit on less favorable terms because the company did not\naward the bank underwriting business. In response, the commercial banks stated that they were not\ninvolved in impermissible tying but rather engaged in the pursuit of relationship banking that is\ncompletely legal, efficient from an economic perspective and, indeed, encouraged by the\nGrammLeach-Bliley Act as a means to provide customers with \"one-stop financial shopping.\"\nSome of the confusion surrounding the tying debate may stem from a misunderstanding of the law.\nNot all tying arrangements are illegal ties. The statute expressly permits certain forms of tying and\nauthorizes the Board to grant additional exemptions by regulation or order. The anti-tying law and the\nBoard's regulations expressly permit a bank to condition the availability or price of a product or service\non a requirement that the customer also obtain a traditional bank product from the bank or an affiliate\nof the bank. A traditional bank product generally is a loan, discount, deposit, or trust service. On the\nother hand, conditioning the availability or price of a loan on a requirement that the customer engage\nthe bank for an underwriting, or obtain some other product or service that is not a traditional bank\nproduct, clearly is prohibited.\nIncidentally, the anti-tying statute applied to banks is tougher than the general corporate antitrust laws.\nUnlike the general anti-tying laws, the statute applicable to banks does not require a showing of\nmarket power to support a violation. It can be difficult to determine whether a violation of the anti-tying\nstatute has occurred, as it generally involves a careful analysis of specific facts and circumstances that\nare not memorialized and can involve divining the intent of the parties to a transaction.\nIn light of these complexities, the Board published and sought public comment on an interpretation of\nthe anti-tying statute and related supervisory guidance. The proposed interpretation was published to\nhelp banking organizations and corporate customers clarify permissible practices under this complex\nstatute in today's financial services environment. Importantly, the interpretation proposes guidelines\nthat could be followed when a bank seeks to engage in traditional \"relationship banking,\" that is,\nserving customers based on the profitability of the overall customer relationship, including the\nestablishment of some regulatory \"safe harbors.\" The guidance would communicate our expectations\nas to the types of policies, procedures, internal controls, and training programs that should help banks\ncomply with the anti-tying restrictions. It would also emphasize the importance of the compliance and\ninternal audit functions in ensuring compliance with the law and regulations.\nAmong the comments received on the anti-tying guidance was a November 7, 2003, letter from the\nDepartment of Justice and published on its own website. The Justice Department has recommended\nthat the Board interpret the anti-tying statute in a manner consistent with, and no broader than, the\ninterpretation of federal antitrust laws. If this limitation is precluded, the Justice Department urged the\nBoard to exercise its statutory authority to expand the scope of exemptions so as to limit the scope of\nthe statute to ties involving small businesses and individual consumers. The letter expressed concern\nthat the anti-tying statute may prohibit some pro-competitive practices, in particular, multiproduct\ndiscounting.\nThe Board's staff continues to review and analyze the comments that have been received, and we\nexpect to issue final guidance later in the year.\nConclusion\nFEI's focus on providing corporate financial officers with information to keep them aware of evolutions\nin best business practices and process has contributed to the financial strength of businesses today.\nThe organization also provides an effective source of dialogue on emerging issues in finance and\ngovernance. I encourage you, as senior officers of your firms, to keep this discussion alive within your\nfirms. When businesses have a strong focus on corporate ethics, a robust internal control culture, and\ntransparent disclosure, financial markets can provide capital efficiently.",

         "Alan Greenspan: Energy\nRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, before the Center for Strategic & International Studies, Washington, DC, 27 April 2004.\n* * *\nThe dramatic rise in six-year forward futures prices for crude oil and natural gas over the past few\nyears has received relatively little attention for an economic event that can significantly affect the\nlong-term path of the U.S. economy. Six years is a period long enough to seek, discover, drill, and lift\noil and gas, and hence futures prices at that horizon can be viewed as effective long-term supply\nprices.\nThese elevated long-term prices, if sustained, could alter the magnitude of and manner in which the\nUnited States consumes energy. Until recently, long-term expectations of oil and gas prices appeared\nbenign. When choosing capital projects, businesses could mostly look through short-run fluctuations in\nprices to moderate prices over the longer haul. The recent shift in expectations, however, has been\nsubstantial enough and persistent enough to influence business investment decisions, especially for\nfacilities that require large quantities of natural gas. Although the effect of these developments on\nenergy-related investments is significant, it doubtless will fall far short of the large changes in our\ncapital stock that followed the 1970s surge in crude oil prices.\nThe energy intensity of the United States economy has been reduced by almost half since the early\n1970s. Much of the energy displacement occurred by 1985, within a few years of the peak in the real\nprice of oil. Progress in reducing energy intensity has continued since then, but at a lessened pace.\nThis more-modest pace should not be surprising, given the generally lower level of real oil and natural\ngas prices that prevailed between 1985 and 2000 and that carried over into electric power prices.\n* * *\nThe production side of the oil and gas markets also has changed dramatically over the past decade.\nTechnological changes taking place are likely to make existing energy reserves stretch further and to\nkeep long-term energy costs lower than they otherwise would have been. Seismic techniques and\nsatellite imaging, which are facilitating the discovery of promising new reservoirs of crude oil and\nnatural gas worldwide, have nearly doubled the success rate of new-field wildcat wells in the United\nStates during the past decade. New techniques allow far deeper drilling of promising fields, especially\noffshore. The newer innovations in recovery are reported to have increased significantly the average\nproportion of oil and, to a lesser extent, gas reserves eventually brought to the surface.\nOne might expect that, as a consequence of what has been a dramatic shift from the hit-or-miss\nwildcat oil and gas exploration and development of the past to more-advanced technologies, the cost\nof developing new fields and, hence, the long-term supply price of new oil and gas would have\ndeclined. And, indeed, these costs have declined, but by less than might otherwise have been the\ncase. Much of the innovation in oil development outside OPEC, for example, has been directed at\novercoming an increasingly inhospitable and costly exploratory environment, the consequence of more\nthan a century of draining the more immediately accessible sources of crude oil.\nStill, distant futures prices for crude oil moved lower, on net, during the 1990s as a result of declining\nlong-term marginal costs of extraction. The most-distant futures prices fell from a bit more than\n$20 per barrel just before the first Gulf War to $16 to $18 a barrel in 1999. Distant futures for natural\ngas, which were less than $2 per million Btu at the time of the first Gulf War drifted up to $2.50 per\nmillion Btu by 1999, although those prices remained below the prices of oil on an equivalent Btu basis.\nSuch long-term price tranquility has faded noticeably over the past four years. Between 1990 and\n2000, although spot prices ranged between $11 and $35 per barrel, distant futures exhibited little\nvariation. Currently prices for delivery in 2010 of light sweet crude, roughly equal to West Texas\nintermediate, have risen to more than $27 per barrel. A similar pattern is evident in natural gas. Even\nthe spikes in the spot price in 2000 had only a temporary effect on distant natural gas futures prices.\nThat situation changed in 2001, however, when the distant futures prices for gas delivery at the Henry\nHub began a rise from $3.20 per million Btu to almost $5 today.\nThe reasons for the sharp increases in both crude and gas distant futures prices seem reasonably\nstraightforward, though they differ in important respects. The strength of crude oil prices presumably\nreflects fears of long-term supply disruptions in the Middle East that have resulted in an increase in\nrisk premiums being added to the cost of capital. Although there are competitive spillovers from the\nhigher price of oil, the causes of the rise in the long-term supply price of natural gas appear related\nprimarily to supply and demand in North America.\n* * *\nToday's tight natural gas markets have been a long time in coming. Little more than a half-century\nago, drillers seeking valuable crude oil bemoaned the discovery of natural gas. Given the lack of\nadequate transportation, wells had to be capped or the gas flared. As the U.S. economy expanded\nafter World War II, the development of a vast interstate transmission system facilitated widespread\nconsumption of natural gas in our homes and business establishments. By 1970, natural gas\nconsumption, on a heat-equivalent basis, had risen to three-fourths that of oil. But in the following\ndecade consumption lagged because of competitive inroads made by coal and nuclear power. Since\n1985, natural gas has gradually increased its share in total energy use and, owing to its status as a\nclean-burning fuel, is projected by the Energy Information Administration of the United States to\nmaintain that higher share over the next quarter century.\nDramatic changes in technology in recent years, while making existing natural gas reserves stretch\nfurther, have been unable, in the face of inexorably rising demand, to keep the underlying long-term\nprice for natural gas in the United States from rising.\n* * *\nOver the past few decades, short-term movements in domestic prices in the markets for crude oil have\nbeen determined largely by international market participants, especially OPEC. But that was not\nalways the case.\nIn the early years of oil development, pricing power was firmly in the hands of Americans,\npredominately John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil. Reportedly appalled by the volatility of crude oil\nprices in the early years of the petroleum industry, Rockefeller endeavored with some success to\ncontrol those prices. After the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911, pricing power remained with the United\nStates - first with the U.S. oil companies and later with the Texas Railroad Commission, which raised\nallowable output to suppress price spikes and cut output to prevent sharp declines. Indeed, as late as\n1952 U.S. crude oil production still accounted for more than half of the world total. However, that\nhistorical role came to an end in 1971, when excess capacity in the United States was finally absorbed\nby rising demand.\nAt that point, the marginal pricing of oil, which for so long had been resident on the gulf coast of Texas,\nmoved to the Persian Gulf. To capitalize on their newly acquired pricing power, many producing\nnations in the Middle East nationalized their oil companies. But the full magnitude of their pricing\npower became evident only in the aftermath of the oil embargo of 1973. During that period, posted\ncrude oil prices at Ras Tanura rose to more than $11 per barrel, significantly above the $1.80 per\nbarrel that had been unchanged from 1961 to 1970.\nThe sharp price increases of the early 1970s brought to an abrupt end the extraordinary period of\ngrowth in U.S. oil consumption and the increased intensity of its use that was so evident in the\ndecades immediately following World War II. Between 1945 and 1973, consumption of oil products\nrose at a startling 4-1/2 percent average annual rate, well in excess of growth of real gross domestic\nproduct. However, since 1973, oil consumption has grown, on average, only 1/2 percent per year, far\nshort of the rise in real GDP.\nAlthough OPEC production quotas have been a significant factor in price determination for a third of a\ncentury, the story since 1973 has been as much one of the power of markets as of power over\nmarkets. The signals provided by market prices have eventually resolved even the most seemingly\ninsurmountable difficulties of inadequate domestic supply in the United States. The gap projected\nbetween supply and demand in the immediate post-1973 period was feared by many to be so large\nthat rationing would be the only practical solution.\nBut the resolution did not occur quite that way. To be sure, mandated fuel-efficiency standards for cars\nand light trucks accompanied slower growth of gasoline demand. Some observers argue, however,\nthat, even without government-enforced standards, market forces would have produced increased fuel\nefficiency. Indeed, the number of small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars that were imported into the United\nStates markets grew significantly in the late 1970s after the Iranian Revolution drove up crude oil\nprices to nearly $40 per barrel.\nMoreover, at that time, prices were expected to go still higher. Projections of $50 per barrel or more\nwere widely prevalent. Our Department of Energy had baseline projections showing prices reaching\n$60 per barrel - the equivalent of more than twice that in today's prices.\nThe failure of oil prices to rise as projected in the late 1970s is a testament to the power of markets\nand the technologies they foster. Today, despite its recent surge, the price of crude oil in real terms is\nonly half of what it was in December 1979.\nAs I indicated earlier, the rise in six-year oil and gas futures prices is almost surely going to affect the\ngrowth of oil and gas consumption in the United States and the nature of the capital stock investments\ncurrently under contemplation. However, the responses are likely to differ somewhat between plans for\noil and those for gas usage.\nOPEC, the source of greatest supply flexibility, has endeavored to calibrate crude oil liftings to price.\nThey fear that significant supply excesses will drive down prices and revenues, whereas too low a\nlevel of output will elevate prices to a point that will induce long-term reductions in demand for oil and\nin the associated long-term revenues to be earned from oil.\nNatural gas pricing, on the other hand, is inherently far more volatile than oil, doubtless reflecting, in\npart, less-developed, price-damping global trade. Because gas is particularly challenging to transport\nin its cryogenic form as a liquid, imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) into the United States to date\nhave been negligible, accounting for only 2 percent of U.S. gas supply in 2003. Environmental and\nsafety concerns and cost considerations have limited the number of terminals available for importing\nLNG. Canada, which has recently supplied a sixth of our consumption, has little capacity to\nsignificantly expand its exports, in part because of the role that Canadian gas plays in supporting\ngrowing oil production from tar sands.\nGiven notable cost reductions for both liquefaction and transportation of LNG, significant global trade\nis developing. And high natural gas prices projected by distant futures prices have made imported gas\na more attractive option for us. According to the tabulations of BP, worldwide imports of natural gas in\n2002 were only 23 percent of world consumption, compared with 57 percent for oil. Clearly, the gas\ntrade has a long way to go.\nThe gap in the behaviors of the markets for oil and for natural gas is readily observable. The prices of\ncrude oil and products are subject to much price arbitrage, which has the effect of encouraging the\ntransportation of supplies from areas of relative surplus to those of relative shortage and of thereby\ncontaining local price spikes. This effect was most vividly demonstrated in 2003, when Venezuelan oil\nproduction was essentially shut down. American refiners with unlimited access to world supplies were\nable to replace lost oil with diversions from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\nIf North American natural gas markets are to function with the flexibility exhibited by oil, more\nextensive access to the vast world reserves of gas is required. Markets need to be able to adjust\neffectively to unexpected shortfalls in domestic supply in the same way that they do in oil. Access to\nworld natural gas supplies will require a major expansion of LNG terminal import capacity and the\ndevelopment of the newer offshore re-gasification technologies. Without the flexibility such facilities\nimpart, imbalances in supply and demand must inevitably engender price volatility.\nAs the technology of LNG liquefaction and shipping has improved and as safety considerations have\nlessened, a major expansion of U.S. import capability appears to be under way. These movements\nbode well for widespread natural gas availability in North America in the next decade and beyond. The\nnear term, however, is apt to continue to be challenging.",

         "Mark W Olson: The Federal Open Market Committee and the formation of\nmonetary policy\nRemarks by Mr Mark W Olson, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the 26th Conference of the American Council on Gift Annuities, Orlando, Florida,\n5 May 2004.\n* * *\nThank you very much for inviting me here this evening. When my longtime friend Lance Jacobson\nextended this invitation more than a year ago, I readily accepted. Several months later, the 2004\ncalendar of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings was released, and I discovered that\nthis meeting would occur on the day following the Committee's May meeting. Because FOMC\nmembers observe a blackout on discussions of the economy for the week before and the week of the\nFOMC meetings, I prefer not to talk about current economic conditions. However, I can provide you\nwith some insight into the way the FOMC functions and the impact of monetary policy on the U.S. and\nglobal economies. My former Federal Reserve colleague Laurence Meyer provided the blueprint for\nthis presentation in a 1998 speech entitled \"Come with Me to the FOMC.\"1 That title, in turn, was\nborrowed from remarks given back in 1951. While my remarks are not identical in either style or\nsubstance, I have borrowed heavily from Larry's presentation, and you have the assurance that they\nhave a long history.\nFirst, a comment or two on who we are. Nineteen policymakers participate in FOMC meetings,\nalthough at most only twelve vote at any one time. At times vacancies on the Board mean that the\nFOMC has fewer than twelve voting members. The Board has now operated at full strength for almost\ntwo years, after several years with two vacancies. Each of the Board members is appointed by the\nPresident of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. Our Chairman, Alan Greenspan, has two\ndesignations: The President has appointed him both as a Board member and as Chairman. A Board\nmember's term is fourteen years, and the Chairman has a term of four years. Though\nAlan Greenspan's chairmanship expires this June, his term as a Board member extends through\nJanuary 2006. As you may know, President Bush announced last year that he intended to reappoint\nMr. Greenspan as Chairman. The Board Vice Chairman is also appointed by the President for a\nfouryear term. The current Vice Chairman, Roger Ferguson, was reappointed last fall.\nIn addition to the Board of Governors, five of the twelve Reserve Bank presidents vote in any given\nyear. The President of the New York Fed is a permanent voting member whereas the other Bank\npresidents vote every other or every third year. If you find this construct confusing, or unduly complex,\nperhaps a bit of background is in order.\nThe Federal Reserve System is generically described as the central bank of the United States. In the\nlate eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries there were two attempts to establish a central bank of\nthe United States, and neither endured for more than twenty years - in contrast to most European\nnations, where central banks were well established by the nineteenth century. Though you may not be\nfamiliar with the history of our central bank, you may well remember learning about the debates on the\nconcept of federalism by our nation's founders, when the forces favoring decentralization, led by\nThomas Jefferson, fought the proponents of a more centralized government, led by Alexander\nHamilton. The Jeffersonian forces largely prevailed. As a result, the United States lacked a strong\ncentral bank presence but had no authority even to grant national charters to commercial banks until\nthe Abraham Lincoln Administration. All bank charters were originally granted by the states and, as a\nconsequence, the United States at one time had more than 25,000 bank charters. Today, we have\nabout 8,000 separate bank charters. By contrast, most other developed nations have fewer than\n100 separately chartered banks.\nIn the early part of the last century, a monetary panic stimulated the legislation leading to the Federal\nReserve Act of 1913. And consistent with our tradition of dispersed economic power, the new central\nbank of the United States was created with a significant grass roots component. As a result, twelve\nFederal Reserve Banks were created, owned by member banks in each District, headed by a Reserve\nBank president, and supervised by the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. To give you a sense of\nthe dispersal of resources within the Federal Reserve, more than 22,000 employees work in the\nSystem, meaning both the Banks and the Board. Of that number, about 1,700 work for the Board in\nWashington, and the remaining 20,000-plus work in the twelve Banks. Of the 1,700 Washington\nemployees, roughly 250 are Ph.D. economists, the majority of whom support the Board's monetary\npolicy responsibilities.\nThe FOMC has eight scheduled meetings each year, roughly every six weeks. Financial markets\nfollow the FOMC's actions very carefully and examine each word in the statement released after each\nmeeting. Today I would like to share with you my perspectives gleaned from thirty months on the\nBoard and twenty FOMC meetings.\nI was most impressed at my first FOMC meeting in December 2001 by the extraordinary level of\npreparation by and for the FOMC members. Let me begin by describing the contributions of the twelve\nBank presidents. Each of the twelve Banks is staffed with economists who monitor the economic\nconditions in their respective Districts. A summary of the regional analysis is compiled in what we call\nthe Beige Book (because it has a beige cover) and released to the public about two weeks before the\nFOMC meeting. Today we are in Florida, which is part of the Atlanta Fed's District, so let me speculate\non how developments in this area's economy may enter our deliberations. Jack Guynn, president of\nthe Atlanta Fed, comes to the meeting prepared to discuss the outlook for the entire Sixth Federal\nReserve District. With respect to this particular part of the District, Jack may discuss Florida's citrus\ncrop, the relative health of the tourism industry, and trends in Florida real estate prices. Because\nFlorida is also a gateway to Latin America, he may also discuss factors affecting trade with that part of\nthe world.\nSimilar preparations take place at each of the other eleven Banks. Though only five presidents vote at\neach meeting, all twelve prepare reports and participate fully in FOMC discussions. The president of\nthe New York Federal Reserve Bank is accorded a special role on the FOMC. That person - currently\nTimothy Geithner - is always a voting member and is traditionally elected as Vice Chairman of the\nFOMC. This role is largely a reflection of the New York Fed's responsibility for implementing monetary\npolicy decisions through its open market desk operations.\nTypically, after the approval of the minutes of the previous FOMC meeting, the first order of business\nis a report from the System Open Market Account (SOMA) Manager at the New York Fed. The\nManager discusses market activity since the most recent FOMC meeting and may also report on any\nother domestic or international market activity that may reflect trends in the U.S. and world economies.\nThe SOMA Manager's report is followed by reports by senior Board economists, including the directors\nof the Division of Research and Statistics and the Division of International Finance. Each report\nsummarizes what we refer to as the Greenbook, which is prepared by a team of economists. The time\nbetween receipt of the Greenbook and the reports by the directors is a time of intense study and\npreparation by the FOMC members. Governors often schedule briefings from Fed economists besides\nconducting their own individual reviews. The materials typically arrive on our desks late Thursday or\nearly Friday and our Board review of economic conditions occurs the following Monday morning. In our\nhousehold, my family has learned that my time during the weekend before an FOMC meeting is often\nlargely consumed in preparation for it.\nWhile the preparation for FOMC members is very intense, I would be remiss if I did not give full credit\nto the effort of the economists preparing the reports. Fed staff economists hold off their Greenbook\npreparation until the last possible minute and supplement it just before the meeting with the most\nup-to-date economic data releases and developments.\nThe Federal Reserve Board has, over time, developed powerful econometric modeling tools to assist\nour understanding of the many interrelated economic forces. In large part because human behavior\ncannot be modeled, we cannot fully anticipate all the factors that can affect our economic policy, and\nno econometric model can predict perfectly. Therefore we often review alternative scenarios that may\nreflect different ways in which the economy may respond in a variety of situations.\nAfter the economists' reports, we turn to the presidents and governors. Typically the presidents report\nfirst on regional economic developments as well as on their independent views on the national\neconomy. Not surprisingly, economists from the Banks and the Board largely agree, but occasionally\ndiscernable differences exist, particularly with respect to economic forecasts. The presidents' reports\noften include anecdotal updates from businesses or other sources to provide real-time information on\nregional economic activity.\nFollowing the presidents' presentations, the Fed governors provide their individual analyses. Our\npresentations focus largely on analysis of the current condition of the economy and, for the most part,\ndo not contain monetary policy recommendations.\nAfter each of the FOMC members has spoken, the director of the Division of Monetary Affairs presents\nthe Bluebook, with prospective policy options for the Committee's consideration. In my time on the\nFOMC, generally two or three options have been presented, each accompanied by a list of pros and\ncons. After the presentation of policy alternatives, FOMC members resume their discussion, focusing\nnow on their policy preferences. In the twenty FOMC meetings in which I have participated, Chairman\nGreenspan's participation in the discussion until this point has been limited. I suspect that this fact\nmight surprise most FOMC observers as Chairman Greenspan, like virtually all of his predecessors, is\nconsidered almost the personification of monetary policy. Yet before the Chairman offers his first\nsubstantive comments at these meetings, eighteen other participants, representing literally hundreds\nof hours of study and analysis, have provided their input.\nConsidering the complexity of the U.S. economy and the implications of monetary policy on the world\neconomy, the issue facing each FOMC member is deceptively simple. We establish a target interest\nrate for what is known as federal funds - or, more commonly, fed funds. Fed funds constitute an\ninterbank arrangement that allows banks with surplus balances at their Federal Reserve Bank to loan\nthose funds overnight to banks that temporarily need to borrow to meet their balance requirements. An\nindividual bank's balances on their Federal Reserve accounts can vary significantly depending on the\ndollar amount of the checks cleared that day, the volume and sequence of wire transfers in and out of\nthe bank's account, and changes in investment or lending at the bank. In the aggregate, fed funds are\nan important indicator of liquidity in the banking system and, by implication, the money supply. All fed\nfunds loans are for a single day, and the interest rate is reestablished daily. Fed funds rates thus are\nan excellent barometer of both the price of money and the changes in the money supply.\nThe Federal Reserve Act requires that monetary policy promote maximum employment, stable prices\nand moderate long-term interest rates. Happily, in this instance, congressional intent is also sound\nmonetary policy. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker once said, \"No central bank can - or\nshould, in my judgment - conduct policies for long that are out of keeping with basic, continuing\nobjectives of the political system.\"2 When I was a young banker in the 1960s, many of my loan\ncustomer's decisions were affected at least in part by memories of the Great Depression. While\ndepression fears were widespread, the ravages of high inflation elsewhere, such as post-World War I\nEurope, had not been experienced here. In fact, many people had a positive view of inflation as\nleading rising property values and were not convinced that inflation was inherently bad. Public policy\ndecisions with inflationary implications - often expressed as funding both \"guns and butter\" - were\nbroadly supported. Only after the high-inflation years of the late 1970s and early1980s, after the\nspending power of incomes had been seriously eroded, were the consequences of inflation fully\nunderstood. Part of the success in achieving consistent economic growth in the United States is due in\nsignificant part to broad public support for our mandated monetary policy objectives.\nFOMC monetary policy affects the money supply through the Open Market Desk at the New York\nFederal Reserve Bank. A team of young (I mean young - half my age or less), whip-smart men and\nwomen begin each workday by analyzing all the factors affecting the money supply. They then gauge\nthe appropriate amount of buying or selling for the Fed's portfolio of government securities required to\nmaintain our target rate. When more liquidity is required, the Domestic Trading Desk purchases\nsecurities. If tightening is in order, the Desk sells into the market, replacing idle balances with\ninvestment securities and thereby marginally reducing the liquidity in the banking system. Though\nthese professionals are young, money market activity conducted by the New York Fed is an\nestablished discipline more than eighty years old. As a result, the team knows from experience how\nbest to maintain the target rate. The daily determination to buy or sell is communicated to a group of\npre-selected securities dealers known as primary dealers, which ensures a consistent and reliable\ngroup of market participants and a competitive bid process for these transactions. The buy or sell\norders are communicated electronically to the primary dealers early each day, and when the bidding is\nopened shortly after 9:30 a.m., the day's transactions are completed within seconds.\nHowever, the FOMC members know that our decisions affect more than the money supply. Many\nother interest rates are indexed directly or indirectly to the fed funds rate. Further, FOMC decisions are\nviewed as an indication of the economy's underlying strength or weakness. In part, because of these\nbroad implications, efforts have been made in recent years to improve our communication practices.\nThe FOMC's current practice is to issue a news release after our regular meetings, about 2:15 p.m.\n(ET). The release currently has three parts. The first part states the fed funds target rate of interest;\nthe second briefly explains and updates our analysis of current economic conditions. The third\nprovides our assessment of the balance of risks with respect to the prospects for price stability and\neconomic growth.\nThe FOMC decision is communicated to the Domestic Trading Desk at the New York Fed, and the\nrevised policy is then initiated and becomes the policy guideline for the next six or seven weeks.\nHowever, the FOMC can reconvene and reconsider its monetary policy stance at any time, at the call\nof the Chairman, as changes in the economy warrant.\nI said earlier that one of my first impressions of FOMC meetings related to the extraordinary level of\npreparation by both economists and members. Let me share two other impressions as well.\nAt most FOMC meetings, the vote on the final FOMC target and the accompanying statement has\nbeen unanimous. This pattern raises an obvious question as to the extent to which votes contrary to\nthe will of the Chairman - or the majority - are tolerated. Having spent several years on Capitol Hill\nwhere unanimous votes on major issues rarely occur, I am particularly conscious of the contrast. One\nreason many votes are unanimous is that there is no \"loyal opposition bloc\" within the Committee. The\nFOMC contains neither caucuses nor coalitions representing either political or philosophic differences.\nSecond, and in stark contrast to other environments, there is a notable absence of posturing, which I\ndefine as an isolated or \"throw away\" vote to make a statement or to call attention to an individual\ncause.\nYet there are clearly discernable differences in economic philosophy among FOMC members. Over\nthe years, FOMC watchers have labeled some of the Committee members as either inflation-fighting\nhawks or growth-promoting doves based on previous voting patterns and public statements. In recent\nmonths, news articles have pointed out the different approaches to policy represented by Governors\nBen Bernanke and Donald Kohn, the Board's two newest members. Governor Bernanke, a widely\nrespected researcher and monetary policy textbook author, has advocated inflation targeting - that is,\npublicly identifying an acceptable range for inflation. Several other monetary authorities, including the\nBank of England, have adopted this approach. Governor Kohn, a career Federal Reserve System\neconomist with an equally stellar reputation in his field, disagrees, preferring that FOMC members\nestablish monetary policy not with a predetermined range of acceptable inflation rates but by\nconsidering a broader range of economic factors. I find this relatively public debate to be both\ninstructive and healthy. It provides evidence of the depth of understanding and analysis by FOMC\nmembers and supports the integrity of FOMC voting patterns when observers note that Ben and Don\nhave recorded identical votes during their tenures.\nOne other thought on the FOMC tendency for unanimous votes concerns the nature of Chairman\nGreenspan's leadership. The Chairman encourages forthright and thorough discussion. He seeks\nconsensus among FOMC members, and the personal views he interjects into the discussion serve\nmore as a beacon than a command. As a result, he achieves consensus through the quality of his\nleadership and the depth of his analysis.\nA final observation concerns the limitations of monetary policy. During the months between my\nnomination and swearing-in to the Board, I read numerous articles and talked with many monetary\npolicy authorities. A common theme during that time of preparation concerned monetary policy's\nlimitations. In his Come with Me to the FOMC article, Larry Meyer wrote eloquently on this very point. I\nwill try to make the same point.\nThe primary role of monetary policy is to achieve price stability. Inflation, as Milton Friedman famously\nsaid, is always a monetary phenomenon. To control the supply of money is also, in the long run, to\ncontrol the rate of inflation. By contrast, monetary policy does not as directly influence employment or\noutput. Therefore, much of the historic strength and resilience of the U.S. economy is only tangentially\ninfluenced by monetary policy. Obviously, output and employment benefit from the environment of\nprice stability that monetary policy works to achieve.\nMonetary policy is also a blunt instrument. It does not, and cannot, target a particular segment of\nsociety or of the economy. FOMC members become very conscious of this fact as every part of the\neconomic cycle seems to benefit some and penalize others. Overwhelmingly, however, monetary\npolicy aimed at achieving price stability and maximum sustainable employment over time provides the\nbest environment for job creation and improving living standards.\nIt has been my privilege to associate with the men and women who constitute the Federal Open\nMarket Committee. Without exception, it is a dedicated, committed, and talented group that fully\nunderstands both the responsibilities and the limitations of making monetary policy for the United\nStates. I hope this presentation has provided some insight into how we carry out our responsibilities.",

         "Alan Greenspan: Globalisation and innovation\nRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Conference on Bank Structure and Competition, sponsored by the Federal Reserve\nBank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, (via satellite), 6 May 2004.\n* * *\nThe United States economy appears to have been pressing a number of historic limits in recent years\nwithout experiencing the types of financial disruption that almost surely would have arisen in decades\npast. This observation raises some key questions about the longer-term stability of the U.S. and global\neconomies that bear significantly on future economic developments, including the future competitive\nshape of banking.\nAmong the limits we have been pressing against are those in our external and budget balances. We in\nthe United States have been incurring ever larger trade deficits, with the broader current account\nmeasure having reached 5 percent of our gross domestic product (GDP). Yet the dollar's real\nexchange value, despite its recent decline, remains close to its average of the past two decades.\nMeanwhile, we have lurched from a budget surplus in 2000 to a deficit that is projected by the\nCongressional Budget Office to be 4-1/4 percent of GDP this year. In addition, we have legislated\ncommitments to our senior citizens that, given the inevitable retirement of our huge baby-boom\ngeneration, will create significant fiscal challenges in the years ahead. Yet the yield on Treasury notes\nmaturing a decade from now remain at low levels. Nor are we experiencing inordinate household\nfinancial pressures as a consequence of record high household debt as a percent of income.\n* * *\nHas something fundamental happened to the U.S. economy and, by extension, U.S. banking, that\nenables us to disregard all the time-tested criteria of imbalance and economic danger? Regrettably,\nthe answer is no. The free lunch has still to be invented. We do, however, seem to be undergoing what\nis likely, in the end, to be a one-time shift in the degree of globalization and innovation that has\ntemporarily altered the specific calibrations of those criteria. Recent evidence is consistent with such a\nhypothesis of a transitional economic paradigm, a paradigm somewhat different from that which fit\nmuch of our earlier post-World War II experience.\n* * *\nGlobalization has altered the economic frameworks of both advanced and developing nations in ways\nthat are difficult to fully comprehend. Nonetheless, the largely unregulated global markets, with some\nnotable exceptions, appear to move effortlessly from one state of equilibrium to another. Adam Smith's\n\"invisible hand\" remains at work on a global scale.\nBecause of a lowering of trade barriers, deregulation, and increased innovation, cross-border trade in\nrecent decades has been expanding at a far faster pace than GDP. As a result, domestic economies\nare increasingly exposed to the rigors of international competition and comparative advantage. In the\nprocess, lower prices for some goods and services produced by our trading partners have\ncompetitively suppressed domestic price pressures.\nProduction of traded goods has expanded rapidly in economies with large, low-wage labor forces.\nMost prominent are China and India, which over the past decade have partly opened up to market\ncapitalism, and the economies of central and eastern Europe that were freed from central planning by\nthe fall of the Soviet empire. The consequent significant additions to world production and trade have\nclearly put downward pressure on domestic prices, though somewhat less so over the past year.\nMoreover, the pronounced fall in inflation, virtually worldwide, over the past two decades has\ndoubtless been a key factor in the notable decline in world economic volatility.\nIn tandem with increasing globalization, monetary policy, to most observers, has become increasingly\neffective in achieving the objective of price stability. But because we have not experienced a sufficient\nnumber of economic turning points to judge the causal linkages among increased globalization,\nimproved monetary policy, significant disinflation, and greater economic stability, the structure of the\ntransitional paradigm is necessarily sketchy.\nNonetheless, a paradigm encompassing globalization and innovation, far more than in earlier\ndecades, appears to explain the events of the past ten years better than other conceptual constructs.\nIf this is indeed the case, because there are limits to how far globalization and the speed of innovation\ncan proceed, the current apparent rapid pace of structural shift cannot continue indefinitely. A couple\nof weeks ago, I indicated in testimony to the Congress that the outlook for the next year or two has\nmaterially brightened. But the outlook for the latter part of this decade remains opaque because it is\nuncertain whether this transitional paradigm, if that is what it is, is already far advanced and about to\nslow, or whether it remains in an early, still vibrant stage of evolution.\n* * *\nGlobalization - the extension of the division of labor and specialization beyond national borders - is\npatently a key to understanding much of our recent economic history. With a deepening of\nspecialization and a growing population free to take risks over a widening area, production has\nbecome increasingly international.1\nThe pronounced structural shift over the past decade to a far more vigorous competitive world\neconomy than that which existed in earlier postwar decades apparently has been adding significant\nstimulus to world economic activity. That stimulus, like that which resulted from similar structural\nchanges in the past, is likely a function of the rate of increase of globalization and not its level. If so,\nsuch impetus would tend to peter out, as we approach the practical limits of globalization.\nFull globalization, in which trade and finance are driven solely by risk-adjusted rates of return and risk\nis indifferent to distance and national borders, will likely never be achieved. The inherent risk aversion\nof people, and the home bias implied by that aversion, will limit how far globalization can proceed. But\nbecause so much of our recent experience has little precedent, as I noted earlier, we cannot fully\ndetermine how long the current globalization dynamic will take to play out.\n* * *\nThe increasing globalization of the post-war world was fostered at its beginnings by the judgment that\nburgeoning prewar protectionism was among the primary causes of the depth of the Great Depression\nof the 1930s. As a consequence, trade barriers began to fall after the war. Globalization was\nenhanced further when the inflation-ridden 1970s provoked a rethinking of the philosophy of economic\npolicy, the roots of which were still planted in the Depression era. In the United States, that rethinking\nled to a wave of bipartisan deregulation of transportation, energy, and finance. At the same time, there\nwas a growing recognition that inflation impaired economic performance. Indeed, Group of Seven\nworld leaders at their 1977 Economic Summit identified inflation as a cause of unemployment.\nMoreover, monetary policy tightening, and not increased regulation, came to be seen by the end of\nthat decade as the only viable solution to taming inflation.2 Of course, the startling recovery of\nwar-ravaged West Germany following Ludwig Erhard's postwar reforms, and Japan's embrace of\nglobal trade, were early examples of the policy reevaluation process.\nIt has taken several decades of experience with markets and competition to foster an unwinding of\nregulatory rigidities. Today, privatization and deregulation have become almost synonymous with\n\"reform.\"\n* * *\nBy any number of measures, globalization has expanded markedly in recent decades. Not only has\nthe ratio of international trade in goods and services to world GDP risen inexorably over the past\nhalf-century, but a related measure - the extent to which savers reach beyond their national borders to\ninvest in foreign assets - has also risen.\nThrough much of the post-World War II years, domestic saving for each country was invested\npredominantly in its domestic capital assets, irrespective of the potential for superior risk-adjusted\nreturns to be available from abroad. Because a country's domestic saving less its domestic investment\nis equal to its current account balance, such balances, positive or negative, with the exception of the\nmid-1980s, were therefore generally modest. But in the early 1990s, \"home bias\" began to diminish\nappreciably,3 and, hence, the dispersion of current account balances among countries has increased\nmarkedly. The widening current account deficit in the United States has come to dominate the tail of\nthat distribution of external balances across countries.\nThus, the decline in home bias, or its equivalent, expanding globalization, has apparently enabled the\nUnited States to finance and, hence, incur so large a current account deficit. As a result of these\ncapital flows, the ratio of foreign net claims against U.S. residents to our annual GDP has risen to\napproximately one-fourth. While some other countries are far more in debt to foreigners, at least\nrelative to their GDPs, they do not face the scale of international financing that we require.\nA U.S. current account deficit of 5 percent or more of GDP would probably not have been readily\nfundable a half-century ago or perhaps even a couple of decades ago.4 The ability to move that much\nof world saving to the United States in response to relative rates of return almost surely would have\nbeen hindered by the far-lesser degree of both globalization and international financial flexibility that\nexisted at the time. Such large transfers would presumably have induced changes in the prices of\nassets that would have proved inhibiting.\nNonetheless, we have little evidence that the economic forces that are fostering international\nspecialization, and hence cross-border trade and increasing dispersion of current account balances,\nare as yet diminishing. At some point, however, international investors, private and official, faced with\na concentration of dollar assets in their portfolios, will seek diversification, irrespective of the\ncompetitive returns on dollar assets. That shift, over time, would likely induce contractions in both the\nU.S. current account deficit and the corresponding current account surpluses of other nations.\nCan market forces incrementally defuse a buildup in a nation's current account deficit and net external\ndebt before a crisis more abruptly does so? The answer seems to lie with the degree of market\nflexibility. In a world economy that is sufficiently flexible, as debt projections rise, product and equity\nprices, interest rates, and exchange rates presumably would change to reestablish global balance.5\nWe may not be able to usefully determine at what point foreign accumulation of net claims on the\nUnited States will slow or even reverse, but it is evident that the greater the degree of international\nflexibility, the less the risk of a crisis.6\nShould globalization continue unfettered and thereby create an ever more flexible international\nfinancial system, history suggests that current account imbalances will be defused with modest risk of\n3\nThe correlation coefficient between paired domestic saving and domestic investment, a conventional measure of the\npropensity to invest at home for OECD countries constituting four-fifths of world GDP, fell from 0.96 in 1992 to less than 0.8\nin 2002. With rare exceptions, a decline in the correlation of countries' paired domestic investment to domestic saving\nimplies an increased dispersion of current account balances.\n4\nIt is true that estimates of the ratios of the current account to GDP for many countries in the nineteenth century are\nestimated to have been as large as, or larger, than we have experienced in recent years. However, the substantial net flows\nof capital financing for those earlier deficits were likely motivated in large part by specific major development projects (for\nexample, railroads) bearing high expected rates of return. By contrast, diversification appears to be a more salient\nmotivation for today's large net capital flows. Moreover, gross capital flows are believed to be considerably greater relative\nto GDP in recent years than in the nineteenth century. (See Alan M. Taylor, \"A Century of Current Account Dynamics,\"\nJournal of International Money and Finance, 2002, pp. 725-48, and Maurice Obstfeld and Alan M. Taylor, \"Globalization and\nCapital Markets,\" NBER Working Paper 8846, March 2002.)\n5\nThe experience over the past two centuries of trade and finance among the individual states that make up the United States\ncomes close to that paradigm of flexibility, even though exchange rates among the states have been fixed. Although we\nhave scant data on cross-border transactions among the separate states, anecdotal evidence suggests that over the\ndecades significant apparent imbalances have been resolved without precipitating interstate balance-of-payments crises.\nThe dispersion of unemployment rates among the states, one measure of imbalances, spikes during periods of economic\nstress but rapidly returns to modest levels, a pattern reflecting a high degree of adjustment flexibility. That flexibility is even\nmore apparent in regional money markets, where interest rates that presumably reflect differential imbalances in states'\ncurrent accounts and hence cross-border borrowing requirements have, in recent years, exhibited very little interstate\ndispersion. This observation suggests either negligible cross-state-border imbalances, an unlikely occurrence given the\npattern of state unemployment dispersion, or more likely very rapid financial adjustments.\n6\nAlthough increased flexibility apparently promotes resolution of current account imbalances without significant disruption, it\nmay also allow larger deficits to emerge before markets are required to address them. Moreover, the apparent ability of the\nU.S. economy to withstand the stock market plunge of 2000, the terrorist attacks of 9/11, corporate governance scandals,\nand wars in Afghanistan and Iraq indicates a greater degree of economic flexibility than was apparent in the 1970s and\nearlier.\ndisruption. A Federal Reserve study of large current account adjustments in developed countries,7 the\nresults of which are presumably applicable to the United States, suggests that market forces are likely\nto restore a more long-term sustainable current account balance here without measurable disruption.\nIndeed, this was the case in the second half of the 1980s.\nI say this with one major caveat. Protectionism, some signs of which have recently emerged, could\nsignificantly erode global flexibility and, hence, undermine the global adjustment process. We are\nalready experiencing pressure to slow down the expansion of trade. The current Doha Round of trade\nnegotiations is in some difficulty owing largely to the fact that the low-hanging fruit of trade negotiation\nhas already been picked in the trade liberalizations that have occurred since the Kennedy Round.\n* * *\nAugmenting the dramatic effect of increased globalization on economic growth, and perhaps at some\ntimes, fostering it, have been the remarkable technological advances of recent decades. In particular,\ninformation and communication technologies have propelled the processing and transmission of data\nand ideas to a level far beyond our capabilities of a decade or two ago.\nThe advent of real-time information systems has enabled managers to organize a workforce without\nthe redundancy required in earlier decades to ensure against the type of human error that technology\nhas now made far less prevalent. Real-time information, by eliminating much human intervention, has\nmarkedly reduced scrappage rates on production lines, lead times on purchases, and errors in all\nforms of recordkeeping. Much data transfer is now electronic and far more accurate than possible in\nearlier times.\nThe long-term path of technology and growth is difficult to discern. Indeed, innovation, by definition, is\nnot forecastable. Nonetheless, the overall pace of productivity growth that has recently been near\n5 percent at an annual rate is highly likely to slow because we have rarely exceeded 3 percent for any\nprotracted period. In the United States, we have always employed technologies at, or close to, the\ncutting edge, and we have created much of our innovative technologies ourselves. The opportunities\nof many developing economies to borrow innovation is not readily available to us. Thus, even though\nthe longer-term prospects for innovation and respectable productivity growth are encouraging, some\nnear-term slowing in the pace of advance to a rate closer to productivity's long-term average seems\nlikely.\n* * *\nWe have, I believe, a reasonably good understanding of why Americans have been able to reach\nfarther into global markets, incur significant increases in debt, and yet fail to produce the disruptions so\noften observed as a consequence. However, a widely held alternative view of the past decade cannot\nreadily be dismissed. That view holds that the postwar paradigm is still largely in place, and key\nfinancial ratios, rather than suggesting a moving structure, reflect extreme values of a fixed structure\nthat must eventually adjust, perhaps abruptly.\nTo be sure, even with the increased flexibility implied in a paradigm of expanding globalization and\ninnovation, the combination of exceptionally low saving rates and historically high ratios of household\ndebt to income can be a concern if incomes unexpectedly fall. Indeed, there is little doubt that virtually\nany debt burden becomes oppressive if incomes fall significantly.\nBut rising debt-to-income ratios can be somewhat misleading as an indicator of stress. Indeed the ratio\nof household debt to income has been rising sporadically for more than a half-century, a trend that\npartly reflects the increased capacity of ever-wealthier households to service debt. Moreover, a\nsignificant part of the recent rise in the debt-to-income ratio also reflects the remarkable gain in\nhomeownership. Over the past decade, for example, the share of households that owns homes has\nrisen from 6 percent to 69 percent. During the decade a significant number of renters bought homes,\nthus increasing the asset side of their balance sheets as well as increasing their debt. It can scarcely\nbe argued that the substitutions of debt service for rent materially impaired the financial state of the\nnew homeowner. Yet the process over the past decade added more than 10 percent to outstanding\nmortgage debt and accounted for more than one-seventh of the increase in total household debt over\nthat period.8\nThus, short of a period of overall economic weakness, households, with the exception of some highly\nleveraged subprime borrowers, do not appear to be faced with significant financial strain. With interest\nrates low, debt service costs for households are average, or only marginally higher than average.\nAdding other fixed charges such as rent, utilities, and auto-leasing costs does not materially alter the\nchange in the degree of burden.\nEven should interest rates rise materially further, the effect on household expenses will be stretched\nout because four-fifths of debt is fixed rate of varying maturities, and it will take time for debt to mature\nand reflect the higher rates. Despite the almost two percentage point rise in mortgage rates on new\noriginations from mid-1999 to mid-2000, the average interest rate on outstanding mortgage debt rose\nonly slightly, as did debt service.\nIn a related concern, a number of analysts have conjectured that the extended period of low interest\nrates is spawning a bubble in housing prices in the United States that will, at some point, implode.\nTheir concern is that, if this were to occur, highly leveraged homeowners will be forced to sharply\ncurtail their spending. To be sure, indexes of house prices based on repeat sales of existing homes\nhave outstripped increases in rents, suggesting at least the possibility of price misalignment in some\nhousing markets. A softening in housing markets would likely be one of many adjustments that would\noccur in the wake of an increase in interest rates.\nBut a destabilizing contraction in nationwide house prices does not seem the most probable outcome.\nIndeed, nominal house prices in the aggregate have rarely fallen and certainly not by very much.\nStill, house prices, like those of many other assets, are difficult to predict, and movements in those\nprices can be of macroeconomic significance. Moreover, because these transactions often involve\nconsiderable leverage, they need to be monitored by those responsible for fostering financial stability.\nThere appears, at the moment, to be little concern about corporate financial imbalances.\nDebt-to-equity ratios are well within historical ranges, and the recent prolonged period of low long-term\ninterest rates has enabled corporations to fund short-term liabilities and stretch out bond maturities.\nEven the relatively narrow spreads on below-investment-grade corporate debt appear to reflect low\nexpected losses rather than an especially small aversion to risk.\nThe resolution of our current account deficit and household debt burdens does not strike me as overly\nworrisome, but that is certainly not the case for our yawning fiscal deficit. Our fiscal prospects are, in\nmy judgment, a significant obstacle to long-term stability because the budget deficit is not readily\nsubject to correction by market forces that stabilize other imbalances.\nOne issue that concerns most analysts, especially in the context of a widening structural federal\ndeficit, is inadequate national saving. Fortunately, our meager domestic savings, and those attracted\nfrom abroad, are being very effectively invested in domestic capital assets. The efficiency of our\ncapital stock thus has been an important offset to what, by any standard, has been an exceptionally\nlow domestic saving rate in the United States. Although saving is a necessary condition for financing\nthe capital investment required to engender productivity, it is not a sufficient condition. The very high\nsaving rates of the Soviet Union, of China, and of India in earlier decades, often did not foster\nsignificant productivity growth in those countries. Saving squandered in financing inefficient\ntechnologies does not advance living standards. It is thus difficult to judge how significant a problem\nour relatively low gross domestic saving rate is to the future growth of an efficient capital stock. The\nhigh productivity growth rate of the past decade does not suggest a problem. But our success in\nattracting savings from abroad may be masking the full effect of deficient domestic saving.\n* * *\nOur day-by-day experiences with the effectiveness of flexible markets as they adjust to, and correct,\nimbalances can readily lead us to the conclusion that once markets are purged of rigidities,\nmacroeconomic disturbances will become a historical relic. However, the penchant of humans for\nquirky, often irrational, behavior gets in the way of this conclusion. A discontinuity in valuation\njudgments, often the cause or consequence of a building and bursting of a bubble, can occasionally\ndestabilize even the most liquid and flexible of markets. I do not have much to add on this issue except\nto reiterate our need to better understand it.\n* * *\nThe last three decades have witnessed a significant coalescing of economic policy philosophies.\nCentral planning has been judged as ineffective and is now generally avoided. Market flexibility has\nbecome the focus, albeit often hesitant focus, of reform in most countries. All policymakers are\nstruggling to understand global and technological changes that appear to have profoundly altered\nworld economic developments. For most economic participants, these changes appear to have had\npositive effects on their economic well-being. But a significant minority, trapped on the adverse side of\ncreative destruction, are suffering. This is an issue that needs to be addressed if globalization is to\nsustain the necessary public support.\n* * *\nThe competitive state of banking, the subject of this conference, will be significantly affected by the\npath of global financial and technological innovations. In my judgment, this will be among the most\nsignificant developments affecting banking in the next decades.",

         "Susan Schmidt Bies: Financial innovation and effective risk management\nRemarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, to the Financial Services Institute 2004, Washington, DC, 6 May 2004.\n* * *\nIntroduction\nThank you for inviting me to speak at this very timely seminar on the evolution of the financial services\nindustry. The industry has indeed evolved over the four-and-one-half years since passage of the\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act - and perhaps in many respects, it has evolved in directions different than\nsome envisioned when the act was under consideration in the Congress. Today I would like to discuss\nthe evolution of the industry and the development of innovative products, services, and activities,\nespecially in the areas of complex structured finance transactions and credit risk transfer. I will then\ndiscuss the role of counsel in ensuring the effective risk management of these innovations through a\nrobust enterprise-wide risk-management framework.\nIndustry evolution and innovation\nThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act recognized the market reality that the limitations imposed by the\nGlass-Steagall Act in the 1930s and other statutory restrictions had been rendered nearly irrelevant by\nfinancial innovation, much of it outside the banking industry. Gramm-Leach-Bliley realigned the law to\nreflect the existing realities of the marketplace and to permit banks to do more efficiently what they\nwere already doing in costly ways. The statute relaxed long-standing restrictions on affiliations among\ncommercial banks, securities firms, and insurance companies; authorized the Federal Reserve Board\nand the Treasury to designate additional financial holding company activities as \"financial in nature\" or\n\"incidental to a financial activity;\" and authorized the Federal Reserve Board to determine whether\nactivities are \"complementary to a financial activity.\" To avoid extending to these new activities the\nsubsidy implicit in deposit insurance and in access to the Federal Reserve's discount window and\npayment system guarantees, the act requires that many of these activities be conducted through a\nlegally separate bank holding company affiliate, provided also that the holding company meets the\n\"well-managed\" and \"well-capitalized\" criteria for designation as a financial holding company.\nWhen Gramm-Leach-Bliley became law in 1999, many predicted the rise of the financial conglomerate\n- an entity that would provide a full range of banking, securities, and insurance products and services\nto institutional and retail customers. However, this prediction has not been realized, and the pace of\nchange has been relatively slow since 1999. The slow pace is, no doubt, partly a result of the\neconomic slowdown and stock market decline from 2000 to last year. But I suspect that these factors\ndo not explain fully why we have not seen the rise of the financial conglomerate. Indeed, I suggest that\nthe benefits that might result from running a financial conglomerate are in fact much more difficult to\nrealize than many may have thought. True, there are now in excess of 600 domestic financial holding\ncompanies. But most of these are relatively small. Roughly three-quarters of financial holding\ncompanies have assets of less than $10 billion. Fewer than one-third of all financial holding companies\nhave reported engaging in newly authorized activities, and most of these have opted to engage in\nrelatively well-understood and less-risky insurance agency activities. Thus, the activities of most\nbanking organizations have not changed significantly since Gramm-Leach-Bliley.\nHowever, innovation in financial products and services has continued since Gramm-Leach-Bliley.\nMany of these innovations cross sector boundaries and involve banking, securities, and insurance\nfirms. Today, I will talk about two of these innovations: complex structured finance transactions and\ncredit risk transfer.\nComplex structured finance transactions\nInnovation has occurred in the development of complex structured finance transactions, which have\nreceived quite a bit of negative press of late. While we are all too aware that recent events have\nunfortunately highlighted the ways in which complex structured transactions can be used for improper\nor even fraudulent purposes, these transactions, when designed and used appropriately, can play an\nimportant role in financing businesses and mitigating various forms of financial risks.\nAlthough deal structures vary, complex structured finance transactions generally have four common\ncharacteristics. First, they typically result in a final product that is nonstandard and is structured to\nmeet a customer's specific financial objectives. Second, they often involve professionals from multiple\ndisciplines and may involve significant fees. Third, they may be associated with the creation or use of\none or more special-purpose entities designed to address the customer's economic, legal, tax, or\naccounting objectives or the use of a combination of cash and derivatives products. Fourth, and\nperhaps most important, they may expose the financial institution to elevated levels of market, credit,\noperations, legal, or reputational risk.\nFinancial institutions may assume substantial risks when they engage in a complex structured finance\ntransaction unless they have a full understanding of the economic substance and business purpose of\nthe transaction. These risks are often difficult to quantify, but the result can be severe damage to the\nreputations of both the companies engaging in the transactions and their financial advisers - and, in\nturn, impaired public confidence in those institutions. These potential risks and the resulting damage\nare particularly severe when markets react through adverse changes in pricing for similarly structured\ntransactions that are designed appropriately.\nAssessments of the appropriateness of a transaction for a client traditionally have required financial\nfirms and advisers to determine if the transaction is consistent with the market sophistication, financial\ncondition, and investment policies of the customer. Given recent events, it is appropriate to raise the\nbar for appropriateness assessments by taking into account the business purpose and economic\nsubstance of the transaction. When banking organizations provide advice on, arrange, or actively\nparticipate in complex structured finance transactions, they may assume legal and reputational risks if\nthe end user enters into the transaction for improper purposes. Legal counsel to financial firms can\nhelp manage legal and reputational risk by taking an active role in the review of the customer's\ngovernance process for approving the transaction, of financial disclosures relating to the transaction,\nand of the customer's objectives for entering into the transaction.\nOn the regulatory side, the Federal Reserve has been working with the other federal banking agencies\nand the Securities and Exchange Commission to develop interagency guidance on complex structured\nfinance transactions. We believe it is important for all participants in complex structured finance\ntransactions to understand the agencies' concerns and supervisory direction. Our goal is to highlight\nthe \"lessons learned\" from recent events as well as what we believe on the basis of supervisory\nreviews and experience, to be sound practices in this area.\nAs in other operational areas, strong internal controls and risk-management procedures can help\ninstitutions effectively manage the risks associated with complex structured finance transactions. Here\nare some of the steps that financial institutions, with the assistance of counsel and other advisers,\nshould take to establish such controls and procedures:\n•\nEnsure that the institution's board of directors establishes the institution's overall appetite for\nrisk (especially reputational and legal) and effectively communicates the board's risk\ntolerances throughout the organization.\n• Implement firm-wide policies and procedures that provide for the consistent identification,\nevaluation, documentation, and management of all risks associated with complex structured\nfinance transactions - in particular, the credit, reputational, and legal risks.\n•\nImplement firm-wide policies and procedures that ensure that the financial institution obtains\na thorough understanding of the business purposes and economic substance of those\ntransactions identified as involving heightened legal or reputational risk and that those\ntransactions are approved by appropriate senior management.\n• Clearly define the framework for the approval of individual complex structured finance\ntransactions as well as new complex structured finance product lines within the context of\nthe firm's new-product approval process. The new-product policies for complex structured\nfinance transactions should address the roles and responsibilities of all relevant parties and\nshould require the approval of all relevant control areas that are independent of the profit\ncenter before the transaction is offered to customers.\n•\nFinally, implement monitoring, risk-reporting, and compliance processes for creating,\nanalyzing, offering, and marketing complex structured finance products. Subsequent to\nnew-product approval, the firm should monitor new complex structured finance products to\nensure that they are effectively incorporated into the firm's risk-control systems.\nOf course, these internal controls and risk-management processses need to be supported and\nenforced by a strong \"tone at the top\" and a firm-wide culture of compliance.\nWe expect that banks, as a result of recent public and supervisory attention to complex structured\nfinance transactions, will be asking more questions, requesting additional documentation, and\nscrutinizing financial statements more carefully to guard against reputational and legal risk. In fact, our\nsupervisory reviews indicate that many financial institutions have already taken steps to enhance their\ninternal controls and new-product approval processes in order to filter out transactions that pose\nunacceptable levels of reputational and legal risk. As a result, some financial institutions have turned\ndown deals with unfavorable risk characteristics - deals that they might have accepted in the past.\nWhile we applaud these developments, we hope that the guidance we are developing will help further\nincrease awareness, among both banking organizations and their advisers, of sound practices in this\narea.\nI would like to note that the guidance the agencies issue should be considered the first step in the\nevolution of sound practices for complex structured finance transactions. As these transactions take\non new characteristics or different or heightened levels of risk over time, the sound practices for\nmanaging them also will need to evolve.\nCredit risk transfer\nSome of the complex structured finance transactions we have recently seen reflect and incorporate\ninnovations in credit risk transfer mechanisms - credit default swaps and synthetic collateralized debt\nobligations in particular. As most of you know, credit default swaps involve the sale or transfer of credit\nrisk associated with a specific reference entity for a fixed term in exchange for a fee from the buyer of\nthe protection. Synthetic collateralized debt obligations entail similar arrangements but are based on\nportfolios of exposures and are tranched in a manner typically seen in securitizations. Credit default\nswaps and collateralized debt obligations provide flexibility in tailoring and marketing financial\ntransactions to match the risk appetites of investors.\nOne aspect that we, as bank supervisors, find encouraging about the growth of credit risk transfer\nactivity is the diversification benefit it provides and its potential for greater economic efficiency. By their\ndesign, derivative instruments segment risks for distribution to those parties most willing to accept\nthem. A key point, however, is that these parties should be able to successfully absorb and diffuse any\nsubsequent loss. The ability to handle any losses on these instruments requires a recognition and\nunderstanding of the underlying risks. It is important to recognize that the market for these instruments\nis dominated by large institutions and private investors that have specialized expertise in credit\nanalysis and significant historical performance records.\nAs bank supervisors, we are also encouraged by the progress made by the legal profession to resolve\nlegal issues relating to credit risk transfer. The standardization of documentation for credit derivatives\ntransactions and the issuance of legal opinions regarding the enforceability of these contracts have\nprovided increased certainty to the market. In general, the contracts have performed as expected.\nBy way of note, the Federal Reserve is participating in work commissioned last year by the Financial\nStability Forum to gain a broader understanding of issues related to credit risk transfer. I look forward\nto the conclusions and assessments of this group.\nLittle evidence, to date, suggests that the institutions and investors that engage in most of the credit\nrisk transfer activities fail to understand the risks of these transactions. That said, I would offer one\ncritical caveat regarding the use of any model for risk-management purposes, including the pricing and\nrisk management of increasingly complex credit risk transfer instruments. Models use historic data and\nrely heavily on supporting assumptions, including correlations between different reference entities. It is\nworth reminding ourselves that correlations may behave very differently during times of stress than\nunder normal circumstances. Further, these are relatively young products, and the markets in which\nthey trade often do not have deep liquidity. Thus, pricing information can be very volatile.\nGiven the heavy reliance on models in this arena, it is important that any risk-management framework\ninclude an independent model review program. A review should be conducted by qualified\nindependent staff prior to actual reliance on a model, and periodically thereafter. Tests should include\nvalidation of results, data integrity, and internal controls over changes in model specifications. Models\nshould be appropriate for the specific products and the nature of the risks at an institution.\nEnterprise-wide risk-management framework\nThe recent innovations in credit risk transfer and complex structured finance transactions offer\nopportunities for the development of new markets, improved pricing, and better risk-transfer\nmechanisms that can improve the efficiency of U.S. and world financial markets. However, innovation\nalso presents risk-management challenges. I believe that these challenges are addressed most\neffectively through an enterprise-wide risk-management framework that provides a structure for\ndealing with uncertainty and its associated risks and opportunities.\nAs you may know, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or\nCOSO, has published an exposure draft that sets forth an enterprise-wide risk-management\nframework, including the definition and components of risk management and the roles and\nresponsibilities of various parties. Enterprise-wide risk management is a process that involves people\nat every level of the firm in setting strategy and making operational decisions based on an analysis of\nevents that may impact the firm. Through an enterprise-wide risk-management framework, an entity\ncan better limit exposures within its risk appetite and provide its management and board of directors\nwith reasonable assurances regarding the achievement of the organization's objectives.\nRecent operational breakdowns at financial institutions underscore the need for enterprise-wide risk\nmanagement. As organizations expand into more lines of business, inherent conflicts of interest\nbecome more likely. Conflicts can arise when a firm offers research on fixed-income securities to\ninvestors and underwrites the public offerings of the same securities. And problems may occur if an\norganization offers compensation designed to encourage officers to increase deal volume without\nregard for reputational, credit, or legal risks. Thus, the traditional approach of managing risks only\nwithin individual business lines or functions may no longer be effective. Viewing risks across the\nenterprise can help management and the board of directors not only articulate more clearly the \"most\nlikely\" outcome of a strategy, change in process, or transaction but, more important, focus on a range\nof possible results to facilitate a discussion of risks and effectiveness of processes to lay off or mitigate\nthose risks.\nInternal controls are an integral part of enterprise-wide risk management. Under COSO's Internal\nControl Framework, directors have responsibility for overseeing internal control processes so that they\ncan reasonably expect that their directives will be followed. Directors should also keep up with\ninnovations in corporate governance, and this is one key area in which the legal advisers of financial\ncompanies can assist their clients. Indeed, legal counsel can help lead the way to developing sound\npractices in corporate governance.\nWhile we are discussing the importance of effective internal controls, let me point out that the Public\nAn\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) has recently approved Auditing Standard No. 2,\nAudit of Internal Control over Financial Reporting Performed in Conjunction with an Audit of Financial\nStatements.1\nThe new standard highlights the benefits of strong internal controls over financial\nreporting and furthers the objectives of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The standard requires external\nauditors of public companies to evaluate the process that management uses to prepare the company's\nfinancial statements. External auditors must gather evidence regarding the design and operational\neffectiveness of the company's internal controls and determine whether evidence supports\nmanagement's assessment of the effectiveness of the company's internal controls. While the new\nstandard allows external auditors to use the work of others, including that performed by internal\nauditors, it emphasizes that external auditors must perform enough of the testing themselves so that\ntheir own work provides the principal evidence for making a determination regarding the company's\ncontrols. On the basis of the work performed, the external auditor must render an opinion as to\nwhether the company's internal control process is effective - a requirement that constitutes a relatively\nhigh standard.\nIn addition, as part of its overall assessment of internal controls, the external auditor is expected to\nevaluate the effectiveness of the audit committee. If the audit committee is deemed to be ineffective,\nthe external auditor is required to report that assessment to the company's board of directors. While\nsome skeptics may wonder if a public accountant will criticize its client, the goals are to strengthen\nprofessional standards and to remind accounting firms that acceptance of an engagement at a firm at\nwhich internal control weaknesses are not promptly addressed may be a risk exposure they should\nseriously reconsider. I would encourage the attorneys here today to adopt the best practices in risk\nmanagement that the accounting and financial firms are implementing to improve their organizations'\ngovernance.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the financial services industry has evolved considerably over the past several years, in\nlarge part because of innovation in products, services, and activities, particularly in the areas of\ncomplex structured finance transactions, credit risk transfer, and risk management. These innovations\nhave the potential, I believe, to substantially improve the efficiency of the financial markets. However,\nthese new products, services, and activities present challenges. Legal counsel can play an important\nrole in helping financial institution clients understand and address these challenges through the\ndevelopment of a sound enterprise-wide risk-management framework.",

         "Susan Schmidt Bies: US - EU regulatory dialogue\nTestimony of Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington, DC,\n13 May 2004.\n* * *\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to speak today on matters relating to the informal\nU.S.-EU Financial Markets Regulatory Dialogue. I would like to focus my remarks on the Dialogue's\nrole in helping us to monitor European-wide regulatory developments in financial services and\nunderstand the effects on U.S. banking organizations operating in the European Union.\nBackground to the dialogue\nAs has been noted, the Dialogue was initiated by the Treasury Department in 2002, at a time of\nsignificant regulatory developments in both the European Union and in the United States. At that time,\nthe European Union was continuing its efforts, begun in 1999, to establish a single market in financial\nservices by implementing the \"Financial Services Action Plan\" (FSAP). The FSAP consists of a\nnumber of regulatory and legislative measures designed to achieve, among other things, a single\nwholesale European market; open and secure retail markets; and state-of-the-art prudential rules and\nsupervision. On our side of the Atlantic, U.S. regulators were continuing to implement provisions of the\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act and Congress was considering reforms that led to the adoption of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act. These developments, which affected European financial services firms with U.S.\noperations, naturally were of interest to staff of the European Commission.\nFrom the outset, the Dialogue's purpose has been to foster a better mutual understanding of U.S. and\nEU regulatory approaches and to identify potential substantive conflicts in approach as early in the\nregulatory process as possible. The Dialogue consists of an informal discussion or explanation of\nregulatory approaches, developments, and timetables, conducted at an experts level. This format has\nserved us well during the past two years. Although the Federal Reserve has regular contact with staff\nof the European Commission in other groups on a range of issues, the Dialogue is the only venue\ndedicated specifically to U.S.-EU regulatory issues.\nFederal Reserve's interest in monitoring foreign regulatory developments\nAs the umbrella supervisor of U.S. bank holding companies and financial holding companies, the\nFederal Reserve has a strong interest in the regulatory environments in which these firms operate\noutside the United States. We have an established program of working with foreign supervisors at both\nbilateral and multilateral levels. Through regular contact, we track changes to foreign bank regulatory\nand supervisory systems and seek to understand how these systems affect the banking institutions we\nsupervise.\nThis is especially important in the European Union, where U.S. banking organizations have substantial\noperations. As of September 30, 2003, thirty-four U.S. banking organizations operated in the\nEuropean Union with aggregate EU assets of more than $747 billion. As of December 31, 2003,\nsixty-eight EU banking organizations maintained active banking operations in the United States, with\ntotal third-party banking assets in their U.S. offices of $937 billion. As these figures suggest,\ninstitutions from the United States and the EU are major participants in each other's markets.\nThe dialogue as an additional forum for monitoring EU regulatory developments\nAs the EU seeks increasingly to harmonize financial services rules across its internal market, the\nregulatory role of the European Commission has grown correspondingly. In this environment, the\nDialogue complements the Federal Reserve's ongoing relationships and discussions with EU national\nregulators.\nThe Dialogue, moreover, fills a role not presently served by any one of those ongoing relationships\nand discussions. As the market for financial services becomes increasingly integrated, the interests of\nbanking, securities, and insurance regulators correspondingly are becoming more common and\nintertwined. The Dialogue provides a forum for discussion of issues in each of these areas. The\nregulatory discussions benefit from this sharing of different substantive perspectives. For this reason,\ntoo, the Dialogue is an efficient forum for information exchange, which has great utility for supervisors\nof large complex financial services organizations.\nGlobal companies operate across many countries and must adapt their business and strategy to local\nregulatory and supervisory requirements. It is now generally accepted in the U.S. and internationally\nthat a foreign firm that conducts business in a local market should receive national treatment, that is,\nthe foreign firm should be treated no less favorably than a domestic firm operating in like\ncircumstances. The United States adopted a specific policy of national treatment for foreign banks\noperating in this country with the enactment of the International Banking Act of 1978.\nAs we have previously testified, implementing a policy of national treatment can be challenging.\nAlthough large financial services companies operate in a globalized world, each is based in a specific\ncountry whose economic regulation or supervisory approach will differ from those in other countries.\nThe challenge of providing national treatment arises as we seek to adapt our own regulatory system to\na foreign banking organization that operates under a different legal and regulatory structure. We\nbelieve the Federal Reserve has successfully met the challenge in its treatment of foreign banking\norganizations operating in this country. Part of that success can be attributed to our work with foreign\nregulators and supervisors in seeking to understand the operating environment of the foreign banks\nwe regulate. The Dialogue contributes to that knowledge.\nWe are equally concerned that U.S. banking organizations receive national treatment in their foreign\noperations. The Dialogue provides us the best opportunity to understand EU directives that affect\nthose operations and provides us with the ability to raise concerns directly with the staff that has\nresponsibility for the preparation and presentation of such directives.\nThe Dialogue provides a useful forum for information exchange between U.S. regulators and the\nEuropean Union over Europe-wide matters that have the potential to affect the application of national\ntreatment in particular situations. In implementing the FSAP in the European Union, the European\nUnion has an obligation to ensure that the rules adopted are consistent with the principle of national\ntreatment. It is our expectation that the European Commission and the member states will continue to\nseek to do so.\nSelect issues discussed during the dialogue\nThe Dialogue has touched on a variety of issues in the past two years. Of particular interest to the\nFederal Reserve and to U.S. banking organizations operating in the EU is the issue of the application\nof the EU's Financial Conglomerates Directive to U.S. financial firms. This Directive, and others that\nhave been amended in connection with its adoption, establishes various supervisory requirements for\nEU firms. Among other matters, it requires that the consolidated group be subject to supervision and\nminimum capital standards by a member state authority. For firms that are headquartered outside the\nEU, such as U.S. banking organizations, the directives require that the foreign financial firm operating\nin EU markets must be subject to supervision at the holding company level by a competent home\ncountry authority, which supervision is equivalent to that provided for by the provisions of the Directive.\nThe EU's national supervisors will be responsible for making equivalency determinations on a\ngroupby-group basis, in accordance with guidance issued by the European Commission. In the absence of\nan equivalence determination, U.S. financial firms with EU operations could be subject to higher\ncapital and risk control requirements or be required to create an EU sub-holding company.\nThe European Commission is preparing guidance on what might constitute equivalent supervision by\nthird countries. In preparing this guidance, committees working under the auspices of the Commission\nconvened a technical group comprised of member state supervisors to provide input on issues to be\ntaken into account in verifying equivalence. The group sent questionnaires to home country\nsupervisors of financial organizations having operations in the EU, inquiring about the measures those\nsupervisors take to ensure that the entities they supervise are subject to consolidated supervision at\nthe top-tier level. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency prepared a\njoint response on supervision of U.S. banking organizations with EU operations. We understand that\nthe EC's guidance is expected to be issued in the summer.\nMember state lead regulators are expected to rely on the European Commission's guidance in\nverifying equivalent supervision with respect to individual institutions. We anticipate that the European\nCommission will keep us informed of member states' progress in this regard during the Dialogue and\nalso will alert us to the existence of and procedures for addressing any disparities in member states'\napproaches. We fully expect that U.S. banking organizations will be found to meet the supervision\nstandard of the directive.\nAnother topic of discussion relating to banks has been the status of work on revisions to the Basel\nCapital Accord (Basel II). The discussions within the Dialogue have not focused on technical issues\nthat have been under consideration within the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel\nCommittee), but rather have addressed the scope of application and implementation and timing\nconcerns. Specifically, the Dialogue has served as a useful venue for both the EU representatives and\nthe Federal Reserve participants to gain a better understanding of the implementation procedures that\nare anticipated to be applicable in each jurisdiction. Staff has been able to ask questions about the EU\nlegislative process, and to explain in detail how the U.S. regulatory process functions. Understanding\nthe requirements and limitations of each others' legislative and regulatory processes has helped both\nsides achieve, in my view, a better sense of the implementation challenges we all face and of the\ncommitment to see the process through.\nWith regard to the scope of application of the proposed new Accord, the Federal Reserve\nrepresentatives were able to provide information for the EU participants about the reasons the U.S.\nbanking agencies proposed to require only a core set of banks to apply the advanced approaches for\nboth credit risk and operational risk. As you know, one of the primary drivers behind this decision was\nthe U.S. banking agencies' collective view that complex, sophisticated organizations should be using\nthe most advanced risk measurement and management practices available and those techniques and\npractices are recognized in the Basel II advanced approaches. The U.S. agencies also proposed\npermitting other institutions to move voluntarily to the advanced approaches subject to the same\nrigorous risk measurement and management requirements as core banks. Through the Dialogue, the\nparticipants were able to discuss the U.S. approach and to compare it with the EU proposal to apply\nBasel II to all of its banks and investment companies. These different implementation strategies will\nraise some issues, and that is why the Basel Committee has created the Accord Implementation\nGroup to coordinate implementation across jurisdictions and work through home-host issues.\nAs noted, issues are not resolved during Dialogue discussions; that is not the purpose of the Dialogue.\nBut open communication that fosters understanding can feed back into the decision-making\ndiscussions when they are held in other appropriate forums. With respect to Basel II implementation\nand the Dialogue, in my view, the current structure will continue to serve a useful purpose - as\nimplementation issues are identified, the Dialogue can be a venue for candid, informal communication.\nParticipants can take back to their constituents the results of those discussions and the subject matter\nexperts can determine how best to address issues that are raised or respond to particular questions or\nconcerns.\nThe Dialogue has been useful in diffusing tensions over matters that have a direct impact on global\nfirms. This has been especially true with respect to issues under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a discussion\nof which I shall leave to my SEC colleague. The Dialogue has also been helpful on less high profile\nmatters. Through discussions at Dialogue meetings, we were able to keep EC staff apprised of\ndevelopments relating to asset pledge requirements applicable to foreign banking organizations\nhaving U.S. offices.\nFor more than forty years, federal and state bank licensing authorities have imposed an asset pledge\nor capital equivalency deposit requirement on U.S. branches and agencies of international banks,\nprimarily for safety and soundness reasons. This requirement obligated such institutions to hold\ncertain negotiable securities at American custodian banks. In recent years, foreign banks were of the\nview that such requirements were more onerous than necessary and sought a reduction in the level of\nassets to be pledged. The matter was brought to the attention of European Commission staff who\nraised it at the Dialogue. We were able to inform Commission staff of progress being made on this\nfront by state authorities in New York and elsewhere over a two-year period. New York changed its\nasset pledge requirement in 2003, generally satisfying the concerns of foreign banks. The Dialogue\nwas a useful forum to keep Commission staff apprised of developments during this period.\nInternational accounting\nThe FSAP also contemplates mandating adherence to international accounting standards. Currently,\nbanking organizations in the European Union may prepare their annual financial statements in\naccordance with the accounting standards of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB),\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), and/or national standards. The use of\nU.S. GAAP is usually limited to those banking organizations or other companies whose securities are\npublicly traded on U.S. stock exchanges and are registered with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission. In many cases, these companies will also provide separate financial statements based\non their national accounting standards and disclosure rules. The European Union will require all EU\ncompanies listed on EU exchanges that are currently following national standards to follow IASB\nstandards by 2005 and will require those EU companies that currently follow U.S. GAAP to adopt IASB\nstandards by 2007. The EU is also working to adopt international auditing standards for external audits\nof EU companies, including banks.\nThe IASB is now independent of the international accounting profession and independently funded. It\nhas adopted many of the structural elements of the FASB in the United States, which are intended to\npromote an independent, objective standards-setting environment. Many senior American accounting\nexperts serve on the IASB and its staff. IASB GAAP has many similarities with U.S. GAAP and the\nIASB issued extensive enhancements to its standards last year and this year, with additional\nimprovements also issued as a proposal this year. For example, in recent months the IASB issued\nmajor revisions to its standards for financial instruments, which are similar to U.S. GAAP and cover\nmany areas of banking activities. One aspect of these revisions by the IASB significantly improved the\nguidance on loan loss allowances in ways that could lead to better bank reserving practices around\nthe world.\nThe Federal Reserve has long supported sound accounting policies and meaningful public disclosure\nby banking and financial organizations with the objective of improving market discipline and fostering\nstable financial markets. The concept of market discipline is assuming greater importance among\ninternational banking supervisors as well. Basel II seeks to strengthen the market's ability to aid bank\nsupervisors in evaluating banking organizations' risks and assessing capital adequacy. It consists of\nthree pillars, or tools: a minimum risk-based capital requirement (pillar I), risk-based supervision (pillar\nII), and disclosure of risks and capital adequacy to enhance market discipline (pillar III). This approach\nto capital regulation, with its market-discipline component, signals that sound accounting and\ndisclosure will continue to be important aspects of our supervisory approach.\nThe Federal Reserve and the other U.S. banking agencies are also actively involved in the efforts of\nthe Basel Committee to promote sound international accounting, auditing, and disclosure standards\nand practices for global banking organizations and other companies. For example, an official of the\nFederal Reserve Board is a member of the Standards Advisory Council that advises the IASB and its\ntrustees on IASB projects, proposals and standards. The U.S. banking agencies have been active in\nsupporting the Basel Committee in its work with the IASB's technical advisory groups to enhance the\nIASB's standards for financial instruments and bank disclosures. The Federal Reserve Board has also\nbeen active in supporting the Basel Committee's projects with the International Federation of\nAccountants (IFAC) and other international regulatory organizations, such as International\nOrganization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), to promote substantial enhancements to global\nstandards and practices for audits of banks and other companies.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve Board has been actively involved in addressing international accounting\nand auditing issues primarily through our involvement in the Basel Committee's projects, the Securities\nand Exchange Commission has had the primary role in discussing these matters with the EU\nrepresentatives as part of the Dialogue.\nCooperation on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing issues\nWhile not historically part of the U.S.-EU Dialogue, recent anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist\nfinancing regulatory initiatives on both sides of the Atlantic have had a significant impact on banking\norganizations, many of which operate globally. Because of the potential consequences of differences\nin regulatory approaches in this area, governments have been in frequent contact. In the end, the\nanti-money laundering provisions set forth in the USA PATRIOT Act and those contained in the EU\nAnti-Money Laundering Directive are generally in harmony.\nPart of this can be attributed to the Federal Reserve's and other U.S. and EU regulatory authorities'\nmutual involvement in multilateral policy efforts to improve regulatory systems so to prevent these\ncrimes, such as the Financial Action Task Force and the Basel Committee's cross-border banking\ngroup. On a practical level, supervisory dialogue and cooperation on anti-money laundering and\ncounter-terrorist financing also has been necessary due to the role the Federal Reserve frequently\nshares with its EU counterparts as \"home/host\" supervisors of global banking organizations. However,\nthis cooperation is typically focused on providing assistance in order to fulfill supervisory mandates,\nnot to conduct money laundering or terrorist financing investigations, the authority for which typically\nfalls with law enforcement authorities.\nWhile Bank Secrecy Act requirements, including the provisions added by the USA PATRIOT Act,\ngenerally do not extend to foreign operations of U.S. banking organizations, the Federal Reserve is\ninterested in understanding the global operations of the banking organizations under Federal Reserve\nsupervision as a matter of safety and soundness. In this regard, the Federal Reserve relies upon\ncommunication with supervisors from foreign jurisdictions, including EU member states, in which\nbanking organizations subject to Federal Reserve supervision have material operations.\nCritical information obtained in the course of an examination, which may impact a banking\norganization's operations in the foreign jurisdiction, is typically exchanged among relevant supervisors.\nFor example, when a Federal Reserve Bank conducts an on-site examination of a foreign banking\norganization in the United States, and significant problems are identified with regard to its anti-money\nlaundering program, the Federal Reserve contacts the home country supervisor to discuss the findings\nand to develop corrective action plans.\nMoreover, the Federal Reserve may provide information to European Union member bank supervisors\nwhen administrative penalties have been imposed or any other formal enforcement action has been\ntaken against a U.S. banking organization (whether or not it is related to anti-money laundering\nrequirements) if the Federal Reserve believes such information will be important to the host country\nsupervisor. The Federal Reserve expects the same from its counterparts.\nFuture of the dialogue\nAs is evident from the tenor of my remarks, the Federal Reserve has found the Dialogue to be a useful\nvehicle for monitoring the rapid regulatory developments in the European Union and exchanging\ninformation. We are committed to continuing discussions with the Commission on matters of mutual\ninterest, both bilaterally and as part of the financial markets regulatory discussions led by the Treasury\nDepartment. The regulatory landscape in the European Union is certain to continue to develop rapidly\nin the coming years, particularly with expansion of the European Union, member states'\nimplementation of the numerous FSAP measures needed to create a single market for financial\nservices, and the growing integration of our capital markets.\nWe at the Federal Reserve have an obligation to keep apprised of these developments on a timely\nbasis in order to fulfill our supervisory function and to ensure a level playing field for U.S. banking\norganizations operating in the European Union. We are confident that continuing the Dialogue in its\npresent form would facilitate these objectives.\nWe are equally confident that other existing multilateral and bilateral exchange mechanisms are\nappropriate venues for discussing policies and attempting to resolve disputes. In our view, formalizing\nthe Dialogue - for example, by elevating it to the principals level or expanding its mandate to include\npolicy-setting or dispute resolution functions - would be unnecessary and may impair the Dialogue's\nutility.\nThe Federal Reserve believes that U.S. banks are second to none in their ability to compete when\nthey are given the opportunity of operating on a level playing field. Providing strong supervision at\nhome and participating in international regulatory and supervisory groups such as the Dialogue helps\nassure that our banking organizations will continue to have such opportunities.",

         "Alan Greenspan: Financial literacy\nRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\nSystem, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's Money Smart Conference, Chicago, Illinois (via\nvideoconference), 13 May 2004.\n* * *\nThis morning I should like to broaden the focus of financial literacy to the education you are going to\nneed more generally in the years ahead.\nWithin the next several years the vast majority of you will have completed your formal schooling and\nbegun careers in private business, government, or the nonprofit sector. I suspect most of you have not\nas yet figured out what career you would like to pursue. But as with all the generations of teenagers\nthat have gone before you, something will grab your interest and engage you. With me it was music. I\nwas entranced with sound and visualized myself playing with the likes of the Glenn Miller orchestra or\nbecoming another Benny Goodman. I practiced clarinet and saxophone three to five hours a day and,\nfollowing graduation from high school, toured the country for a couple of years with a dance band.\nI was a good amateur but only an average professional. I soon realized that there was a limit to how\nfar I could rise in the music business, so I left the band and enrolled at New York University.\nDuring my dance band years I spent the twenty-minute breaks from playing in reading. I became\nintrigued by books on finance, and, hence, at NYU I majored first in finance and, as my interest\nbroadened, in economics and in what was then called mathematical statistics and now econometrics.\nIn retrospect, that choice probably was not surprising since math was my most engaging course in\nhigh school.\nI graduated and joined an economic research organization. But my education did not stop. I earned a\nmasters degree and went on to further studies at night at Columbia University.\nAt the age of twenty-seven I joined a very small Wall Street firm as a partner and was essentially in\ncharge of making it grow. It did, and I eventually became the senior partner. But twelve hours a day at\nwork left little time for school, and my aspirations to earn a Ph.D. faded, at least for a time. However,\nthe pursuit of my profession as an economist and the head of a consulting firm required that I broaden\nmy knowledge, and I proceeded to read books, not only on economics and mathematics but also on\nphilosophy, history, physics, and astronomy. I was getting a liberal education far beyond the required\ncurriculum of college. Eventually I returned to NYU, took additional courses at night, and completed\nmy doctorate.\nOver the past six decades I followed a type of career path that many of you will follow, but with a\ntwenty-first-century cast. I had two careers and four jobs - one as a musician, one as a private\nconsultant, and two in government.\nBut the world has changed since I was your age, and the pace of change has quickened. Today it is\nrare that one will finish school and then engage in the same job until retirement, which was the general\nexperience of generations past. Many of you will switch professions once, possibly many times.\nAlmost all of you will have several jobs, some many jobs.\nTo succeed, you will soon learn, as I did, the importance of a solid foundation in the basics of\neducation - literacy, both verbal and numerical, and communication skills. But beyond that you will\nneed to acquire the on-the-job skills that you will need as you move from one job to another. At some\npoint, almost all of you will lose a job and will want to be reemployed as quickly and as productively as\npossible. That means you will need the capability of learning a wholly new activity.\nThe current workforce is increasingly turning to community colleges to prepare for new professions\nand new jobs. Today, almost a third of those enrolled in community colleges are thirty years old and\nolder. So-called adult education was a rarity in my youth; today it is widespread.\nMost of you probably will be engaged in some form of learning through most of your working lives.\nAlready numerous corporations have regularly scheduled classes in basic and advanced subjects\ndirectly and indirectly related to job requirements. Such corporate universities, as they are called, are\ngrowing rapidly, and I suspect that, as you join the workforce, you will have the sensation that you\nnever left school. That is why it is so critical that you productively employ your current learning\nexperiences to create the base capabilities necessary for continuing your education into your mature\nyears.\nLearning, of course, need not be formal. You can engage in it on your own. In generations past, much\nlearning occurred outside a classroom. I am fascinated by the eloquent and literate letters written by\nsome Civil War enlisted personnel, who I doubt had formal schooling beyond the age of ten. Many of\nthese soldiers obviously learned to read and discovered a whole new world of ideas in books. Today's\nhigh-school graduates will be confronted with a breadth of ideas never contemplated by an eighteen\nyear old in the 1860s.\nThe world into which you graduate will require far greater conceptual skills than was required of your\nparents and grandparents. Productive and satisfying manual labor that engaged previous generations\nwill become increasingly less available as technology substitutes for so many of those earlier skills.\nYour future incomes will depend on your conceptual abilities.\nJust as important, because the complexity of our economic system continues to increase, the skill\nlevel that you reach in your twenties will surely be inadequate for the needs of our economy when you\nreach forty. So education must be ongoing.\nBut education alone will not guarantee a successful life. In this regard, let me leave you with some\nchallenges I left with a graduating class at Harvard a few years ago.\nDecades from now, as you begin to contemplate retirement, you will want to be able to say that\nwhatever success you achieved was the result of honest and productive work and that you dealt with\npeople the way you would want them to deal with you. It is decidedly not true that \"nice guys finish\nlast,\" as that highly original American baseball philosopher, Leo Durocher, was alleged to have said.\nI do not deny that many appear to have succeeded in a material way by cutting corners and by\nmanipulating associates, both in their professional and in their personal lives. But material success is\npossible in this world and far more satisfying when it comes without exploiting others. The true\nmeasure of a career is to be able to be content, even proud, that you succeeded through your own\nendeavors without leaving a trail of casualties in your wake.\nI cannot speak for others whose psyches I may not be able to comprehend. But in my working life, I\nhave found no greater satisfaction than achieving success through honest dealing and strict\nadherence to the view that, for you to gain, those you deal with should gain as well. Human relations -\nbe they personal or professional - are not, and should not be treated as, zero-sum games.",
