The first third is true to the form of A Sailor of Austria. An edifying slice of history told in a delightful fashion. Every page includes something fascinating about the Austro Hungarian empire as well as something laugh out loud funny. The other two thirds don't achieve the same level though.

So far, it seems to be doing quite well. I was a bit leary of the way the pump fits into the faountain (from the bottom, through a hole in the body of the bowl), but the O-ring seems to be doing its job and I've not detected any leaks yet. (That said, I'd have been more comfortable with a design where the pump inserted from the top, into a 100% sealed bowl-unit, as with the FreshFlow.)The filters for these units have not been bastardised (yet) as those for the FreshFlows have been; when it comes to my beloved pet I will not tolerate any cost-cutting tomfoolery with the design. The huge reservoir is a plus, as is the deep bowl. Be assured, if the thing starts to leak in future I will update this review accordingly; for now, 4 Stars.",

I dont really know what to label them, yet they seem to combine death and hardcore music (grindcore perhaps?) and put an interesting twist on things. Please dont listen to the reviewer that said that might sound somewhat like Hatebreed. Hatebreed is not a bad band, yet they are strictly modern hardcore, and Red Cord puts themself in another catorgory by sticking to a mostly \"Death/Grind\" Format. But to move on with the review, this is a really good album. It is a bit much to absorb at first as the combination of styles kinda plays with you, yet it seems to grow on you the more you listen. The Red Cord is a treat to extreme music, and hopefully they will continue to give us some great albums in the future. ENJOY",

I bought two sets at different times and neither set had any chips so the packaging for shipping was appropriate.3. They do seem to make things more moist when you soak them prior to using. I'm not sure you want this for ALL breads, but for pumpkin/banana that sort of thing it's awesome. I think you could not soak if you don't want the moisture.4. I haven't used them really often as I only bake for other people, not myself, but these are what I use now for any kind of recipe that I need a loaf pan for.5. I think they would be really cute to serve bread in at family parties.Quick review of instructions in case you've lost yours:Soak for 15 minutes in water prior to using. Start pans off in a COLD oven to gradually bring them to temp.**The first time I used these I forgot to do this and they didn't shatter, but it's probably not a good idea to take chances.",

You have to get a knife, and in the nut and saddle, thicken the wedges wear the strings go in, and make them deeper.Second, the standard tuning for a guitar is eadgbe. eadgbe on this size instrument will have to much slack with the strings because of the scale size. So there are to instruments that come similar to this. A guitalele made by yamaha(not sold in the U.S) and a requinto which is a mexican instrument that is also tuned to adgcea. ADGCEA would be the same tuning as putting a capo on the 5th fret of a guitar.So, tune it up to ADGCEA, the sound is brilliant, and so unexpected.",

Readable not just for the historian, but the layman as well, the writing is superb. Snippets of information in side boxes offer amusing and informative anecdotes. One major strength of this work is that fact that the reader comes away with an idea of the Japanese perspective on the West, specifically the United States. Often either demonized or put on a pedestal by Westerners, this book provides insight into both the strengths and weaknesses of Japan as well as the West. The only drawback is that this book ends in the early 1990s, before the onset of deep recession in Japan. It would be of great value to get Dr. Boyle's perspective on the decade of the 90s and how the Japanese recession has affected Japan-US relations, as well as Japanese attitudes towards Japan itself.",

I saw this when it was broadcast on PBS. It presents a Soviet view of the war with all that entails but you really can't overdramatize what happened there.",

I agree with another reviewer that the ending was somehow less than what I expected, however, it also was one of those endings that leads the viewer to come to their own conclusion. You have nine people in a room and the truth is that they know each other, but they don't know how they know each other. On the surface, this is a suspenseful movie; underneath that, its a lesson about how the choices we make in life, affect the lives of others. Great movie!",

As any developing mystery series I expect the characters to expand as the series does. If you find out everything about a character at the beginning of the series what is there to discover later? Barbeque is big business and Lou Jane Temple does as many other authors do, sets the characters and story line in a place she knows.Again, I recommend this series to anyone who likes an enjoyable mystery and wants some yummy recipes to add to their menus.",

I think it stinks that you have to buy extra screens and rainguards for strollers when you will ovbiously need these items! Other than that this stroller has been a lifesaver. I recently brought home twin boys, and once my \"help\" left town after two weeks, it was great to be able to run the babies around the neigborhood.

         "The Bigs is both HARD and FUN Here's the deal:The Bigs can be very frustrating at first. Most of this frustration is caused by the manual being horrible at descirbing the required motions with the wiimote.However, once you figure out the controls, the game becomes quite fun. If anything, all you need is good coordination and a good memory to have fun (there are ALOT of different wiimote actions).After you get over the controls (it took me a day or two), you can concentrate on enjoying the game. Slow-motion leaps and dives, 30 foot superman-esque jumps off the wall to steal homers, etc. I've read complaints about the swing being delayed a bit compared to wii sports baseball. My answer? Deal with it! Anyone half good at video games will get used to it almost immediately. Some people just like to complain :).I've only had this game for a few days, and look forward to building up my rookie. So far I'm quite satisfied with my purchase.",

Stop reading this review right now and buy it and listen to it as I am: songs you know by heart and thought you knew and that you hear again as if the first time, at once familiar and foreign. Best part: Bob forgetting the opening to \"I Don\\'t Believe You\" and having the audience feed him the line.Just amazing stuff from someone who continues to amaze, even DATE.So enough! I\\'ll leave the philosophizing and preaching to others. I\\'m going back to listen to the CD; I can\\'t get enough of it!', 'Unexpected triumph. I grabbed this album when it was released in DATE and have never grown tired of it. I recently bought the CD, since my cassette tape has long since worn thin. I was drawn to the album by \"Gentlemen Who Fell,\" which received enough airplay to capture my attentinon. I was pleasantly surprised, though, with the rest of the work. \"In a Glade\" became one of my favorites. Since her music is unique, I can only describe the work as a thoughtful, sometimes dark, but lyrically sound and musically engaging piece of art. As one of my favorite albums, I can\\'t say anything negative about this album. Not a mainstream work to appeal to the masses, it is an excellent collection. No regrets, only pleasant surprises. Definitely worth a listen.', \"Great light retro If you get this, you'll buy everything else they've done. This album contains some of the most pop-chart-friendly songs in the VU's repertoire. But they are all still great songs from any perspective. Although the version of Heroin sounds different than the one on the Nico album, it's excellent. If you're a die-hard fan I don't see why you'd need this but if you want a great light retro album to play in the car or at work, and you miss the songs of the NUM's, you've gotta get this! I understand the negative reviews because DATE time I listened to it I was hugely disappointed. But after listening a couple more times I realized it's really a great small collection -- not as challenging as they were known for, but thoroughly enjoyable.\", 'Stellar! Five stars is just enough to describe this CD. If the word \"stellar\" is not enough, I would add \"uncompromising.\" Every track on the CD is a high-quality new experience you will be eager to repeat. You might find yourself completely addicted! I have not stopped listening to this one for DATE, and my changer usually has high turnaround.If it were necessary to pigeonhole the disc, the most likely fit is \"alternative power ballad,\" but expect more creative range and catchiness than that label would allow. What a strong voice my man Waymon has! When the group did a live spot for Atlanta\\'s radio station 99X, he had to stand back from the mic to prevent feedback. This is not overproduced alternative; it is genuine rock quality.', \"One good song... I ordered this CD based on one song I had heard. It turns out that is the ONLY good song on it. The rest of the CD isn't anything I want to listen to. What else can I say? Steer clear...\", \"Simply Magnifficent What can I say?I wish I could give this ten stars.(...)Edie Brickell is my favourite female vocalist of all and I absolutely adore the youthful and sensual beauty of her angelic voiceNot only this the lyrics are very good .Edie ,who writes the lyrics, has a great turn of phrase , 'philosophy is a walk on the slippery rocksreligion is alight in the fog'and 'There's nothing I hate more than nothingNothing keeps me up at nightI toss and turn over nothingNothing can cause a great big fight'And DATE album is by far the best of Edie Brickell and The New BohemiansApart from 'the well known and wonderful 'What I Am' and 'Circle ' there are also other beautiful melodies like 'Little Miss S' , 'Air of DATE' ,'The Wheel' ,Love Like We Do' ,'Circle' ,Beat the Tune' and 'Nothing' I could listen for TIME and still want more.if you like good music I cannot recommend this one enough\", 'a good cd....... but lacks some Kelly clarksons album is good but not as good as i thought. I will give you what i thought for each song.NUM. The trouble with love is NUM/NUM. Kinda boring2. Miss Independant. NUM/NUM The 2nd number one hit from her3. Low NUM/NUM a good song and her voice explodes here4. Some kind of miracle NUM/NUM slow and has no meaning5. Whats up lonely NUM/NUM its ok, u can skip it6. Just missed the train NUM/NUM a great song with cool lyrics7. Beautiful Disaster NUM/NUM another its ok song but has a really good beat8. You thought wrong NUM/NUM AMAZING song. her and tamraya sound great. this song makes this album9.Thankful NUM/NUM catchy tune10. Anytime. a beautiful ballad, sounds like a moment like thisThe last two songs are old but still are good to listen too. So I hope that helps but i would say go out and buy this. It would be worth the money', 'Very Good Album I have been a very big DATE fan for quite some time now, and i was actually getting tired of listening to \"dookie\" or \"nimrod\" all the time, it gets annoying. After i bought \"DATE/Smoothed out slappy hours\" I remembered how great the band was and started to listen to them again. This album shows DATE\\'s fun side, wih all the TIME long power-pop hits that you can handle...from \"Disappearing Boy\" to operation ivy\\'s \"knowledge,\" DATE shows how great the band really is, without the \"SELL-OUT\" label that many losers label the band with.', \"Unfortunate CD I can understand how folks can find this cd interesting - IF you are one of the artists. I listened to this & while it has potential - it is noticable that it is a CD which was produced by a bunch of amatures. Much to their credit, it is a good starting point - I just found it not too worth wild. Turn on an AM station - you'll get the same affect.\", 'Live Recordings Apparently some of the reviews on this CD are for another collection. When you click on the links for those individual reviews, you are taken to a different CD altogether. I only downloaded two tracks, but they were both live versions. I don\\'t want to step on any toes here, but I just can\\'t listen to live Neil Diamond. It\\'s like \"Who are you and what have you done with Neil?\" I always hesitate to give anything a one star. I tend to follow the old adage, if you don\\'t have something nice to say, don\\'t say anything at all, but I don\\'t want others to download this CD expecting something they won\\'t be getting.']",

I am a true B movie fan and am very used to terrible movies, but this one couldn\\'t even be enjoyed from a B perspective. I actaully shut this one off due to complete bordem which is something I never do. The best thing I can suggest for this dvd is that you use it as a frisbee to wing at someone.It was inspired by the true story of a NUM foot crocodile that was responsible for over NUM deaths. This inspires a crew of flunkies to go to Africa to find the man eating beast, but instead takes a turn towards the economic problems of the people. I wish in TIME the croc would have eaten the crew and gotten the movie over with. Orlando Jones starred in this mess in which I saw better acting from him in his old sprite commercials.This one definately doesn\\'t get my seal of approval. Instead of wasting TIME on this disaster pick up a B masterpiece like \"Death Ring\" or \"Lock Up\"', 'A Horrible Waste Of Time This is not a movie, it\\'s an infomercial. A silly attempt at brainwashing. TIME into the film I was asking myself if the well known actors were responsible for community service. This movie was brought to a \"film night\" group that we\\'ve had for DATE. I\\'ve felt compelled to join Amazon in an attempt to insure noone else is scammed, either by purchasing or renting this horrific display of complete stupidity. First the premise that; DATE is holier than modern day. NUM-NUM Civil War. (DATE wacko gets his bible). NUM-NUM Jesse James Gang, The James Younger Gang, Dalton Gang DATE and numerous other outlaw gangs. Apartheid, hangings, child labor, prostitution etc. If you want to laugh out-loud at the too numerous to list idiocies, this propoganda non art, waste of celluloid, hunk of junk has to offer. Sit back and split your sides.', 'Mindless and unoriginal I must say that after having watched this I was offended that a friend had recommended it to me. I have no problems with the movie\\'s message; my problem is with its complete lack of originality. I cannot recall an original moment in this entire movie. What I can recall is gratuitous edginess and a mindless collection of plotlines and vignettes ripped from movies like Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, and the Professional. I understand that in watching a film like this one needs to suspend a measure of disbelief, but this film asks its viewers to be idiots. The dialogue is terrible and the scenarios the characters find themselves in are often moronic. It seems like Duffy had a whole list of \"Holy , wouldn\\'t it be cool if...\" moments and strung them together and expected them to make a movie. My only real wish is to have my TIME back. Be thankful that the sequel never made it off the ground.', 'DATE Movie? Seriously? Movies are my life. I love movies, any kind of movie (except reality...well, anything) yet I am still trying to figure out why anyone would even produce this one. It is hands down the WORST so called DATE movie I have ever watched. I only got through the entire thing because I kept waiting for something good to happen, which by the way NEVER did, at least not until the end credits came. It was not joyous, heartwarming or even remotely close to DATE cheer. Drugs, family despair and hate are not what I call a happy DATE movie. I never realized how normal my family was until investing TIME of my life, which unfortunately I will never get back, into this film so I guess I should thank the people who stupidly put the time and money into this. So thank you and have a Merry DATE.', \"A sad, sad, sad excuse for a movie I'm not sure what's more pathetic: the fact that this film got made in the first place or the fact that so many people have rated it so highly. This is a sad, sad, sad excuse for a movie. Has DATE's movie-going audience really been dumbed down to the point where they consider anything in this movie funny? I sat down not expecting much from this film but at least expecting something I could smile at every now and then. Instead I was subject to TIME of what could, at best, be described as dull. If I wanted to kill this many brain cells in such a short period of time I'd start drinking again.\", \"Boring as hell I waited so long to see this film and when I got to see it on dvd it was by far the worst movie I saw DATE.The reviewers make this movie overrated its so stupid you'll even might get distracted by Roberts drug crack eyes,it was so bad my little brother and mom walk out the living room to see something else,I felt so embarrassed that happen,oh and its nothing like the cartoon and Robert is too damn short to play such a tall man its ridiculous.There is no action at all only at the end and it still sucks.There is so much talking about crap no one cares about and robert trying to make the audience laugh with his corny boring jokes and its very long too so get ready to kill yourself at the end and no I will not be seeing part NUM if I want to see a crackhead I'll just walk down my neighborhood.\", 'Well, that was terrible...

We had to keep getting up to turn down the music - especially during closing histrionics - but I guess that\\'s a matter of taste. I wish we\\'d seen more of the dog, who had the best role.

         "[\"Very Disappointing I'm not sure where to start- from the painfully irrelevant details to the totally unrealistic murder description, this book was a waste of time. The concept of the book sounded good but the execution was terrible. It went on and on about the most unrelated details and when you get to the parts you'd think would be important, they were written in a way that didn't seem realistic in any sense. I understand this is fiction but it appeared the goal of the author was to make you feel like you could be the main character in the book. Instead I found myself cringing with disbelief for most of the book.\", \"'Disappointment is an understatement' 'Disapointment'is an understatement for this book which is, in my DATE of reading, possibly the most awful thing I've read. The idea is, in theory, brilliant, but despite my plodding, persisting and struggling through the pages, I found nothing to suggest it was anything other than - dare I say, amateur. It didn't hang together, it made absolutely no sense and the plots were just fantastical and unrealistic. I won't deny Mitchell's undeniable talent as a critically acclaimed and esteemed author, it's just this book......One of the reviews I read on this site was from someone who had read it and wanted to claim their life back for TIME wasted on reading it. I share this sentiment, having chosen it as the only fiction to bring on my Spanish holiday. Sadly, I feel completely ripped off, conned even. I'd have got more sense from actually sticking my head in the clouds for DATE, and wish I had.\", 'disappointing and truly bizarre I am one for truly bizarre stories, so when I read the reviews for this book I just had to order it. However, upon reading it I was more disappointed than delighted. I felt like the author was trying too hard to be deep and profound. Often times the story would abruptly end and I would be left wondering if there was symbolic or poetic value in it ending where it did, or whether the author just got tired of writing and so ended the story. However, unwilling to leave this book without having given it every chance to redeem itself (or rather, the author, not the book) I read until the very end. I suppose I found in the last story \"Parker Swells\" some remnants of a decent story and so the book is the better for this story. However, I would not recommend this book to anyone and hope that those who do choose to read it are not as disappointed as I was.', 'Confusing, disjointed.....i could not finish it! i would like to know how anyone finished this book. It is an advertisement for future books per and simple. it was so irritating to me that i am writing this review. i would have given it a minus zero if the computer would have let me. i know everyone reads for different reasons and some will like this book but if you want to be stimulated, amused, enthalled or if you simply like strong characters - do not look for it here!i guess the bottom line is i feel cheated!', \"Interesting idea, badly handled... The King quote and the favorable reviews had me anxious to read this, but the story just doesn't pan out. The evil starts to manifest itself with aberrant sexual behavior and torture, and then...just does the same thing over and over again. It's a one trick pony. And the characters, oy! Gifford Stevens, the professor of comparative literature and high explosives (!), is nothing but a cypher, a plot device, and the others don't fare much better. Key plot points happen off-screen, mainly because Little either couldn't explain them logically or didn't want to take the time. And the little epilogue at the end, and the heroes' reaction to it, was especially annoying. In all, not quite as bad as THE MAILMAN, but that's not saying much.\", \"Dismal performance I just finished reading the book about TIME.Nothing happened in this book... nothing at all.There is the extreme attention to detail, but the whole point of a book in a series is to advance the story line. This book really didn't do that.It took me DATE to finish this book, when normally I can go through a NUM pager if it's good in DATE or two.It seemed too much like a chore to read this, not something that was fun.Hopefully book NUM finishes the series, but for some reason I doubt it.\", \"What a waste--don't bother This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It was the most corny and predictable plot I have encountered since middle school. I had never read Patterson before, but having heard such great things and seeing that he is always on the best sellers list, I decided to give this a try. What a complete waste of time. I thought it stunk a few chapters in. but continued because I thought it would get better. It never did, and in fact, it got worse and more unrealistic as the plot went on. The latter parts of the book are cheesier than a soap opera. I don't want to give anything away in case someone out there is crazy enough to want to waste their life away, but the ending is absolutely ridiculous. Please don't buy this book. Do something productive with your life and read something that you won't have figured out in the first NUM pages.\", \"This one goes to the trash can ... Sorry. I hate to pile on, but I must agree with Lit Teacher on this one. The thinking was sloppy and contradictory, and the writing was wooden, stiff, irritating. I bought it DATE back and hid it in a drawer until I could get around to it. I pulled it out DATE with a smile and high hopes.Boy was I disappointed. I thought maybe I was having DATE. Maybe my concentration was off. So I pulled out Truman Capote. Smooth as silk. So it wasn't my fault. It was Ron's. I finally decided to scan the book, and that revealed there was really nothing new here, nothing interesting.I wish I had not wasted the money. I must be more careful. But, as for this book, there is nothing I need to refer to later, so I'm putting it in the trash. It is DATE TIME. They will come on DATE to take it and the other garbage away.Roger\", 'no good ! Hi readers! I am going to write this review from my heart. And my heart says-- this is a bad book! The first problem is the sheer pretense of it all. The devices Mr jah uses are so cliched, that they will make you yawn; his writing style is pedantic and imagination and creative abilities very limited. In the end we have a few pages of sheer boredom. Being a teacher of literature, I have not come across many books which have been hyped so high and fall so low. My advice to readers....This is F grade stuff.', \"Not for me... I only picked up this novel because a friend threatened my life--and I nearly ended hers after reading it. I've read a novel from this author before and didn't like her style of writing; it's written with too many facts, and not enough emotion, which is what I look for in a ROMANCE novel. I want to connect with characters, empathize and weep and ache with them since I'll be spending so much time with them anyway--this author does not provide that, and although this tale is interesting, it falls flat due to lack of character/reader affinity.The heroine seems very likable, although you only get to know her in a single wave-length way, and the hero sounds dashing, although he's sometimes parched, I did like the way the story circled back to the beginning, giving it wholesome synchronicity--but I think that was it.And the ending...The only word I can think of to describe myself, especially after not enjoying the book so much anyway, is inconsolable.\"]",

Both our children clung to it for the first DATE, and we have now passed it on to a cousin. It holds up wonderfully, wipes clean easily, and has lots to entertain kids. Our daughter loved to turn the yellow sun which clicks, and the little orange ball. The teething ring is mostly ornamental, as we have owned far more effective ones. Still, the combination of activities, minimal noises, and no batteries (for once!) made it a parental favorite for us. In DATE and age of bells and whistles, it is refreshingly simple.The only thing we don't like about it is that it falls down very easily. We wish that they would make it more robust for standing, as that is a great feature for kids learning to move around and sit. As it is, it only works well laying down.\", 'Disapointed!

When I expanded the tub, the center never snapped into place, so I could imagine that it would leak water out of it and perhaps could even pinch the baby's skin. I tried everything to get it to snap but had no luck. Then when I tried to collapse it I had such difficulty that by the time I was finished both of my hands were bright red from pushing and pulling and pressing the tabs.

Like many, I was initially quite happy with this product--I couldn't afford a Burley, and this was under $NUM at Target. However, the trailer has slowly fallen apart on me. I leave it outside, but covered underneath a porch and in a mild, dry climate (California). The snaps tore out of the fabric after DATE, which cannot be repaired.

Worst of all, the NUM-inch webbing that runs along the bottom of the seat has rotted through. I consider the trailer unusable now.The only reason I am not giving it one star is that it might hold up better if garaged and lightly used. The price is right, and the design is fine.

The fact that this novel is based on real life events related to a murder has little to do with the actual lifeline of the novel, the richness of the book lies in the near perfect treatment of the ambiences, the perfectly dissected characters, the way it intertwines seemingly disparate pieces on the lives of the characters back and forth to make perfect sense to the story... those thinking this is in the core a murder novel or detective story would be greatly disappointed as there is not a thrilling or morbid side to this story, and the actual events of the murder are almost tangential.

I tried cooking a waffle and the bottom was good, but the top did not get hot and left a big gooey mess inside the maker.I was so disappointed! I ended up purchasing an All-Clad waffle maker from Williams-Sonoma. It was a lot more expensive ($NUM) but performs beautifully.\", 'nice when it works I received this unit as a gift DATE. Nice milk and easy to switch between warm and frothy by such a simple stirring bar. HOWEVER...The fact that the system died on me TIME by the simple virtue of it getting wet negates all the coplementary remarks I just made. A device that designed and fabricated for the kitchen should be hardened and sealed against getting wet. Otherwize, what is the point. Finally, my unit always left a slightly burnt scum on the bottom of the unit that built up after successive runs. This forced me to clean it in the sink, thus creating a circumstance for the bottom to get wet. POOR DESIGN.

Every time I turn to the index to look up a simple topic (e.g., \"paragraphs\" or \"spaces\"), it is invariably absent. Useful information also gets lost on the pages due to the layout. And the book often seems too vague for a \"dummy,\" yet goes into excessive detail in other places. When I popped in the accompanying CD-ROM to use a graphic, the file wasn\\'t there!

Although parts of the book were interesting, the professor and nearly all of the students in the class did not like the book. Several chapters can be eliminated without missing anything. Organization is poor. Information is redundant. Perhaps if this were an online text it would allow for more real time updating of content to make it more interesting. No color images are used but yet it is still very expensive. Figures are not interesting. This text could be improved for use in an MBA introductory course by cutting out NUM-NUM% of the material and making it much more readable to the non IT expert.']",

Overall a small price to pay for an enjoyable read that is a great companion to The Big Book and TIME a Day. The best critique on the upside is that this book can be enjoyed and something garnered regardless of your current place in life.

I've played a good handfull of PS3 games, such as resistance, madden, need for speed and tony hawk and none of these games were as hard as sonic is to master. I do not like the gameplay at all, text boxes get in the way, there are more than one action assigned to a certain control and sometimes the game freezes my playstation NUM. There are many problems wrong with the Sonic game and i could probably go on. Half the time you don't even control sonic and he will fall off the track. SEGA should have spent a lot more time perfecting this game. The graphics, however, are a nice feature... state of the art graphics and the enemies are beatable. Those are the only two things I like about sonic. I stood it out and beat the game but it was hard. Final verdict- the game is a good game if you like to get mad because sonic won't do what you tell him to do. I've played a lot of PS3 games and this is by far the worst, besides marvel alliance.\", 'Best \"#@&%;!\" Game Ever !!

I guess what I\\'m tryin to say is I see nothing wrong with this game, it\\'s one of the best games I have ever played ever. I even liked the horrible ending, it was the perfect ending to the perfect twisted, sick game. Buy it, you\\'ll like it. trust me.', \"the worst spyro... I have never owned a PS, but i had once gone to a friends house and played the spyro games. They were great!!! On gamespot.com, all the old games got at least an NUM, but this one only got a NUM! The thing is, the characters and such make it seem like a stupid game, but parts of it are to challenging for little kids.

The controls, the characters, the story, the additions, the settings, the sounds, the graphics -- everything is wrong or off or outright terrible. Don't make my mistake.I've also watched a friend play all of Onimusha NUM. If you've played the first two and you're looking for more, it's safe to purchase that one. It's not nearly as good as the first two, and in some ways it's different enough that it probably should be even called part of the Onimusha series, but at least it doesn't suck. Skip this product; it's for your own good.I gave it NUM stars overall because it contains Samanosuke, and he deserves some amount of credit for simply existing.\", 'An excellent game I have had this game for DATE, I bought it when I was running a 200mhz with NUM mb ram back in DATE.

But if you stick to some basic controls, your ship is usually durable enough to get you thru any mission. The movie sequences are very cool and the games background music is very true to film scores, but also very original and haunting. Give this game a try for the NUM bucks.Someone should ask if they perfected it for XP, last time I tried it had a lot of problems with XP. I still play it occasionally on an older system running ME and it runs OK.The original version was on NUM cd roms, I can only hope they have condensed it to fewer discs now-a-days.', 'this game is for and one who used there brain more than once this could be so much fun for you if your realy cant get a date but its just a game so do get to happy lol so if you like rpg and like the long crud games that some people dont get go for it i cant say much but its great and the pics are cool but it realy for DATE older if u ask me', \"Not very good... This isn't a good game. When I opened the box and saw a CD and a slip of paper that was the manual, I had a feeling I was in for some disappointment. However, I still held out hope that maybe the game itself was great. It wasn't. The game throws you into the mix without any intruction or tutorial and you are left wondering what to do. I took a look at the box again just to make sure it wasn't a puzzle game. The game basically wants the player to figure everything out with trial and error. Give this a pass.\", \"... well Phantasy star universe is truly a amazing universe but there are some MAJOR flaws in this game. One of these that is truly annoying is that there are chapters in this game. What i mean by chapters is that at the end of a level it ends like a cartoon show and gives you a preview of the next one. Also the single most horrible flaw with this game is that you HAVE TO PAY FOR ONLINE!!!!!! If you have this for the xbox NUM you already pay for your online capabilities but these guys want you to pay more and its ALOT more. Its NUM dollars more to get on and get insulted constantly by a bunch of nerds! If you want to play online in this game get the demo for it because it is free. If this game didn't have horrible voice acting, chapter endings and previews, loading screens that constantly pop up, and a online fee it could have been a great game.

         "[\"Pretty Hardcore for TIME I bought this DVD because even though I work out every day for a little over an hour, it was more like zoning-out. That having been said, even for a more Intermediate-Advanced exerciser like myself, it is VERY high impact. If you're nursing some injuries, even old ones, this may not be for you. I know that after jumping up-and-down for TIME straight my ancient hip injury started to bother me again. Truthfully, I will probably only do this workout when I don't have time for a trip to the gym. But I find her encouraging remarks and approach to exercise useful and will apply it to my regular workout.\", \"It's a great old-fashioned high-impact aerobic workout I've used this workout at home for DATE an it's the best high-impact aerobic workout I've found--and I've tried a few! The music isn't as cheezy as most of them, and I think it's quite inspirational now. This workout starts out slowly, and then it picks up. What I like about it is if I don't feel up to it, I can keep my feet on the floor (not jump if I don't want to) and still feel like I had a good workout. I usually only do the aerobic portion which is only NUM mins, but there's also a toning portion targeting all those fun areas. This workout is definitly in my rotation of workouts.\", \"Great Mix I always enjoy the workouts that Prevention puts together - there's so much variety that you will certainly not get bored. Your heartrate will be up, but I was never gasping for breath (which is good!) Chris definitely has a cheerful personality that isn't overwhelming. She's encoraging, motivating, and makes you hit all the areas of your body. If your looking something that really intense, this video isn't it, but I still feel it's a decent workout. And it's broken up into seperate segments, so if you are crunched for time you can just do what your in the mood for.\", \"Bland Workout I think a great spinning workout should consist of a variety of movements. If you've ever been to a high energy spin class, then that's how I prefer to workout. Target Heart Rate Training fails to be inspiring and fun. I rode TIME into the workout before I realized an overwhelming majority of the workout only consisted of flat roads. TIME towards to end, you do a short standing climb. That's if you can defeat boredom to the end.Also, the music is Christian pop rock. It's tolerable. However, the music levels are way too high. You can barely hear the instructor talk.Overall, I wouldn't recommend buying the DVD unless you can try it beforehand. I was lucky enough to buy the downloadable version for a fraction of the cost although I'm still out of $NUM.\", \"An oldie but a goodie I've had this dvd for DATE and its one I keep coming back to. If it had some exercises for chest and back it would be perfect. (Which is why it only gets NUM, instead of NUM stars from me). As it is, a great workout that you can mix and match to make it as tough as you want. The exercises are solid and Tamilee really knows her stuff. Definitely a classic you should have in your exercise library.\", \"So, so ANNOYING! This has got to be the most annoying workout video I have ever done! I thought Denise Autsin was bad. DATE is so annoying! She talks to her sister-in-law/trainer and thinks she is hilarious. She tries to crack jokes and thinks she is so funny. Her and her SIL's banter is just intolerable.If I do this video again, I will mute the volume and put some decent music on so I dont have to hear DATE.I am so disappointed I bought this. It gets NUM starts because it is a decent workout. It is really long and drawn out, especially the long versions...I would definitely recommend only doing the express workouts. Even with those, I found myself waiting around and sighing.I cant believe there arent more reviews of annoyed viewers!\", \"A Fun Workout The choreography will seem too hard to do if you're a novice video exerciser or if you're not familiar with Christi's workouts. The trick is to LISTEN to her instructions rather than just trying to follow the moves. She is an excellent instructor and I was amazed at how quickly I learned the moves. Uses the best music of any videos I've done and her workouts are always fun to do.\", \"Not really a workout I am of average fitness and have done a few dancing classes - and I didn't find this to be much of a workout at all. I also found that Carmen doesn't always explain the moves properly and there is a lot of focus on her looking sexy but not a lot on teaching you the moves. I bought the discs separately but I really wish that I had purchased the box set because some of the discs' aren't worth it. It's fun to watch and it's not bad for you but not worth it if you are looking for an actual workout.\", \"I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A PIECE OF CAKE Right now I am working on DATE, and waiting for DATE. This one is DATE and it is fantastic. No bouncing, jumping or pounding the knees. It's an old school type of workout like they did on those television workout shows in the DATE, only better. These type of movements make you sweat more than the dancing type, not that dancing is wrong. But more effort is put into this, thus you will burn more. I looked at it first, then tried to do it. There is a message on the tape - DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS UNTIL YOU HAVE FINISHED WEEKS NUM AND NUM.\", \"Don't get this unless you just love Kim This was a complete impulse buy for me, one I regretted as soon as I tried the workout. If you are anything other than a beginner, there is no challenge here. Kim keeps saying how hard everything is and acts as if working out is a burden to her. There is a lot of chatter. One positive is an interesting set. Other than that, there are so many good videos out there and this is not one of them! Don't waste your money, you will be disappointed. Also the emphasis in this workout isn't even the abs; therefore the video's title is a misnomer.\"]",

         "[\"What's the Big Deal? Yes, it's nice to have a NUM mm lens on an auto-everything camera, but other than that, I don't really understand what the big deal (the raves of other reviewers) is with this camera. The pictures are not any sharper than with my Olympus Stylus Zoom, the exposures are not that great under many conditions, it is very difficult -- if not impossible -- to stop the zoom where you want to in the middle of its range, and -- worst of all for me -- the camera comes pre-set with a printable (wrong) date, that unless you reset or erase it will ruin all of your photos!! I stupidly took this camera on vacation without testing it first and shot eleven rolls of film with it. I sure wish I had taken my Olympus instead.\", \"Great camera for most casual users I got this camera DATE and have used it in both indoor and outdoor settings. It takes great pictures, the controls are very easy to figure out but spending TIME with the manual is a good idea. I like the way it feels and where the position of the zoom and shutter are located. At the highest resolution, file sizes have been between NUM and NUM meg. The digital zoom is great - I used it at my son's baseball game and was able to zoom in on an outfielder and get some great shots. Redeye only works in portrait mode - not auto mode (unless I just haven't found the right setting). Flash doesn't automatically pop up when you need it but it will display an icon when you need it. That auto-pop is really the only thing I wish it had. LOVE that the lcd swings out and swivels. This is overall a GREAT camera for those who want something better than your average point and shoot but don't want to spend the $ for the SLR.\", \"Terrible Camera I purchased this camera not even DATE and recently sold it. This is the worst camera I've ever had. It constantly, no matter what setting I had on, underexposed the lighting in pictures, most of the time ruining the shot. Lighting is basically a photographer's lifeblood. And it's too big and bulky. The only good thing about this camera is how the clarity and sharpness are from such high megapixels. That's about it.Do NOT buy this camera, because you'll be sorry. I'm sorry I spent the NUM dollars I did to get this piece of junk. Unless your not a bigtime photographer, you can take just as good shots with a cheap point and shoot camera.\", \"Great Price, Great Capacity, Good Performer on EOS 5D Nothing else beats 8gb under $NUM, on my Canon 5D JPEG capacity NUM,NUM. Memory speed is not a concern due to memory buffer on 5D, erasing and browsing on camera is acceptable a bit slower than extreme III. On the computer with card reader is as fast as any microdrive and slower than extreme III, the same goes for erasing and browsing. Reliability, I took NUM+ pictures without a single glitch (Raw and JPEG). Finally you can put an entire session on a single card. Burst shooting 3fps up to NUM+ pictures (testing) in real life I never take more than NUM.I'll recommended to anyone, Great Price, Great Capacity...\", \"Buy something else I went for a[n] [inexpensive] camera rather than one I knew anything about - my mistake. I've tried three roles of film in this camera, and in two of the roles only a couple of pictures turned out. The rest of the negatives were completely blank! The other roll (the middle one that I tried) actually had pictures on it, but they were poor quality - dark, grainy, and out of focus. I am not an expert photographer, but I certainly think I should be able to do better than this; obviously this is not a high-performance camera. ...\", 'Horrible... I used this camera for a DATE untill during a period of DATE of not being turned on, something to do with the light sensor malfunctioned. I think all Canon ZR series cameras are inclined to having buggy hardware and I dont remcomend buying one.', \"As a pro still photographer... As a professional still photographer just entering the digital camcorder field (I own a digital camera), I viewed this camera with the same eye that I use to shoot publication quality photographs. I really like it's qualities - highly recommend it to my peers and serious amatuers.It's Canon optical 26x zoom is truly awesome and the ability to record in total darkness amazes me. The 'image stabaliztion' really works and the fact that it is a little larger than some digital camcorders is a plus. Size and heft helps stabalize it in hand held situations.\", \"Great Choice I started looking on many sites trying to decide...different recording formats,zoom,still pictures etc.....however the HD is the SUPER best as far as i am concern....I got a steal of a deal...in fact I owe the manufactures money..It is easy to use even my DATE daughter has NO problem operating...the ZOOM is perfect...the still pictures are not great however I have digital camera for that purpose....i think the best things about this device are .NUM How compact and easy to use .NUM No need to worry about finding the spot you last recorded it does it for you .NUM The movies direct to TV or on CD's are GREAT......I love this HD CAMCORDER....\", 'Get what you pay for I thought I was getting a great deal with NUM GB and the price under $10It worked great in my Nikon digital camera...then suddenly it broke (the gold metal on the back came lose) and I no access to the pictures on the disc.You get what you pay for!!', \"horrible This camera is horrible. Especially for the money we paid. It has a flash that you can't turn off and the pictures are better without it. I called and complained about the product. They didn't even listen just sent me a different camera and it was even worse than the first. The new one deletes the pictures when you turn it off.The only decent thing about it is the fun software that comes with it.\"]",

         "['NUM well crafted songs does NOT make a great cd Sorry folks, I hate to burst everyone\\'s bubble - But this release is just not that good. I have listened to this off and on for DATE, waiting for most of the songs to catch on, and what I have found is that most of the cuts are to \\'noise orientated\\' and sloppy. Songs that are plain awful are \\'Bomb\\', \\'Testosterone\\', \\'Monkey\\', and \\'Alien\\'. To much \"whining\" from the lead singer and not a mealody to be found from the guitarist ! I call this a dirty trick, figuring that this is the same group that came up with excellent songs such as \\'Everything Zen\\' and \\'Comedown\\'. These songs show so much craftsmanship that I would expect the same from all (or most) of the songs. It just doesn\\'t happen ! Figuring \\'Razorblade Suitcase\\' and \\'Deconstructed\\' are failures for this band - I think we will be seeing them in DATE on VH1\\'s WHERE ARE THEY NOW segments.', 'One of the best albums of DATE Set aside copyright or CD issues. This is not the artists choice, this is a bigger problem with the whole record industry, and has nothing to do with a \"review\" about the music. I get the feeling some people have not actually taken the time and listened to this entire album before deciding to write some type of disgruntled review, which is ridiculous. This is one of those rare albums that each and every single song on there is absolutely amazing. The kind of CD you put in car and enjoy the ride, because each song makes you move and sing along. The kind of album you put in when friends are over and while they are moving to the beat they ask who it is because its like nothing they\\'ve heard before, but love it. I love music of all genres, from rock to hip hop to country, and this just hits on every mark. This is a brilliant album, and a brilliant artist.', 'A really good cd i\\'m going to have to go with the other reviews and say that this is an awesome cd, but but should not be your first They cd. The songs take some getting used to, but there are some real treasures - \"Hey, Mr. DJ\", \"Don\\'t Let\\'s Start\", and the wonderful Untitled Track NUM - for those of you who are not familiar with this, it is an actual recording from when you could leave a message at Dial-A-Song (NUM-NUM-NUM just a call to local brooklyn!), and a woman named Gloria didn\\'t realize her conference call was being recorded....anyway, if you like They, then get this cd. If not, get another one or two (i\\'d recommend Flood for a first one, or maybe Apollo NUM), then buy it!', \"Sweet Tracks and Poor Tracks About half of this cd is quite good. But many songs bother me or are just very poor. Like the last track especially. It's NUM min are smooth bass pretty much. There is no point to it. The 2nd last track is extremely boring as well. I do not care for the song GD me because of the GD's, and my long walk to jail would be good if it wasn't for some of the lyrics bothering me. Now however:you walk away, american cliche, and where do we go from here are excellent songs. Columbind is quite good, the missing is quite good, the only way is the wrong way is quite good, and so I quit is good. So even though there are quite a few tracks on here that aren't too good, I still think that this is a pretty stinkin good album.So people that like good music, go and pick this puppy up and you won't be disappointed.\", \"OK but not Gods gift. Yeah, I'm glad I bought this CD. But I can tell that after the shine has worn away this will go into my CD case to maybe never come out again. It just doesn't seem to be one of those that will stand the test of time. So, I know other people are wetting themselves about how great this CD is but in my opinion, its good.(NUM year update- I do still take this one out from time to time and listen to it. Surprisingly it has grown on me and the whiney voice didn't grind on me like I thought it would. If I had to make the decision to buy it again I would.)\", 'A very nice CD with a hidden track to boot To be frank, I bought this CD for its hidden track in the pregap of track NUM. I didn\\'t really care about the music at first, but now that I\\'ve listened to it I must say the music is in fact pretty good! I can\\'t really name anything comparable, but if you like rock music in general you should give this CD a try. In my case, it was totally worth it. In fact, I even bought their \"Best Of\" CD because I wanted more. :)', \"Why you have to love this record! Many of us G.L.J. fans wondered whatever became of Gene Loves J, after the fantastic early records Promise and Immigrant, they seemed to drift into a so-so sea of pop mediocrity, What became of the passion and originality of DATE, it's so apparent now! Love Lies Bleeding was clear a signal enough to what was missing all these years and Giving Up The Ghost is dna evidence of the genius lost. This is a remarkable document. So diverse and original and just magnificent. There are so many avenues explored, it's Pollack and Picasso too and poetic and street wise, it rOCKS!!! DATE the world will discover this Artist and I pray sooner than later because Michael deserves recognition above all who walk this landscape. Touching, passionate, tender and witty.

It\\'s perfect for those times when you and the lady have just gotten home from the game (go sox) and want to celebrate beating the other team (A-Rod sucks!).Wayne Coyne has the voice of a freakin angel.

Of course, I\\'m no jazz fan to say the least, so this might explain my choices for best songs. I must say, though, that Diana Krall has a wonderful voice, much better suited to Blues, and it is my opinion that she shouldn\\'t waste it on jazz (which has about as much appeal to me as rap). But that\\'s just me...', \"All the songs sound the same I didn't buy this album. Although I don't think it's nessesary since it seems Everclear is planning on airing all their songs on the radio anyway. All I have to say is that I can't believe almost nobody notices that all the sons use the same chords, over and over again. The only reason I gave this CD an extra star its because some of the lyrics are good and were written with a good purpose, although expressed through a bad medium. I honestly think there's room for improvement... A LOT of room.\"]",

         "[\"Don' bother... Once again I feel the sting of having read a book, studying each line, reading each word...only to be disappointed. If you want to feel that you have spent TIME of your day in a wasted effort, i highly recommend you give this book a read. It leaves you unfulfilled, depressed, and somewhat confused. What starts out as strong character development and a study of a foreign culture disintegrates into sadness and misunderstanding. And i have yet to figure out the strong sexual undertones and graphic descriptions included in the book...perhaps i just don't get it. My mind is full of sand and fog...or maybe i just thought this book sucked.\", \"Couldn't even finish it I couldn't get past page NUM of this book. The action is the type of junk that I wrote when I was DATE. Beyond that, I couldn't tell what kind of book Mr. Brown was trying to write. He mingles bad action, real science, long disproven conspiracy theories, deep religious contemplation, and soap opera romance. It's enough to give any thinking man a headache......guess that's why most of the general public like it so much. NUM% of our population couldn't think there way out of a paper bag. I thought I would read this before I read or saw The DaVinci Code.....I don't think I'll do either now.\", 'Dissapointed I brought this book based on several recommendations. I admit that I didn\\'t read much of it before I gave up - only the first NUM pages - so perhaps I am not the most reliable of reviewers, but this book was so much of a letdown for me that I could not stomach another word (or mention of the dreaded \"cinammon rolls\").My issue with it was that the narrative felt rambling and disorganized. In a scene where the main character has her first meeting with the vampires, the narrative gets so wrapped up in her talking about the past that I could barely follow what was going on. At a pivotal scene such as this, I expected much better writing. Since the author failed to deliver, I felt it not worth my time or effort to keep on reading. Getting even this far in the book was a struggle and a chore for me. I was bored and did not feel any interest for the main character and her obsession with baking. The other characters felt like filler, and the world as a whole was difficult to visualize.', \"Worst book I've read in DATE I bought this book based on the reviews and my recent interest in sci-fi. I'm usually really good at knowing too what I'll like, but sadly from the beginning this book was an epic failure. The character's were hard to follow because there were so many and so much bouncing around. I didn't connect with any of them on an intimate level. There were times that I would have to back track because I got so bored reading that I paid no attention to what I read. There were grammar errors throughout the book and it was so cheezy that I was at times embarrassed I was reading it.I'm halfway through the book now and will not be finishing it. It's a complete waste of space in my brain that could be filled with much more entertaining fiction. Do yourself a favor and don't listen to the good reviews unless you are NUM or under because you will be thoroughly disappointed.\", \"lacking.... I did not enjoy this book. The main character, David, is so shallow and dim, it was very difficult to muster any compassion for his struggles. The writing style was hard to read as well. The author uses a lot of short choppy sentences which made me feel like I was reading a telegraph! It was really depressing to think that a human could actually exist in the main character's condition; there was no depth to this man (or anyone other character in the book for that matter)! Get a life, get a real job, a real brain and a real heart, a strong does of integrity, then maybe the book would have been an interesting read.\", \"This was terrible; there are so many better ones out there! I will tell it to you straight: this book was awful. The characters were cardboard, the plot was contrived, too much time was covered in too short a space, and everything was told rather than shown. It was like Sharon Draper was trying to cram as many issues as possible into the story and they all ended up spilling out, leaving an empty shell. In addition, so many parts were unbelievable. Like: why did the protagonist's father get visitation rights towards his daughter whom he was convicted of molesting?There are so many other, great books out there that deal with the same themes -- please look elsewhere!\", \"Boring, poorly written, unimaginative, typical self-centered Roth Don't waste your money unless you are an insomniac.Even though I find Roth's writing and subject matter to be generally of little interest I bought this book with high hopes after seeing all the great reviews. After all, the subject of altered history is usually intriguing - who wouldn't wonder what the world would be like if the U.S. had stayed out of WWII?Sadly this book is simply a re-hash of the author's rather dull formative DATE in urban New Jersey, with rather predictable dialogue and plot devices. The usual sort of whiney angst you find in Roth novels, with a focus on lower midde class Jewish family life. Even as a member of the tribe I found the presentation to be cliched and booorrrring.If you like Roth's prior works, by all means buy this one. But if you are looking for a fascinating page turner, spend your $$ on a real novel like In Cold Blood.\", 'Absolutely dreadful This book is awful - truly awful. I stopped at page NUM, so there is a possibility that it improves - but I doubt it. It is poorly written and dreadfully uncompelling. The plot is thinly woven and the characters are flat and unlikable. I have heard many people describe this as a \"fun book\" and if you find second rate fluff \"fun\", then this may just be the book for you. The problem that I have with this book isn\\'t that the subject matter is uninteresting, but that the author has a modicum of writing talent at best. I don\\'t like to be harsh about the abilities of others, but I feel it is fair to say that in the hands of a more skilled author this could have been a charming story. Unfortunately, this book is not much better than what you would expect to find in your average DATE diary.', 'Don\\'t Expect Too Much I am a big fan of non-fiction adventure stories, and bought this book based on the advice from this board. The book is basically a yawner. SPOILER COMING: Nothing happens. I kept waiting for either the adventure or the humor. Needless to say, I played the part of the jilted reader. If you read this book, your response will be: \"what\\'s the big deal, I could have done that.\" I think Tim\\'s motivation for this book was solely cash (nothing wrong with that - just warn me first). It was clearly written out of contractual obligation and not because he truly had something to say.', \"Much ado about nothing -- so overrated Never have I been so bored by the style of writing, nor so angry at the flimsy content of a book capitalizing on my favorite artist's life. As stated elsewhere, the cover art was the lure here, and I also had to force myself to finish it, waiting for a momentum which never materialized. This book left me feeling ripped off, since $NUM+ for a paperback is not peanuts. The book's cover hyperbole bears no relation to the book that I plodded through. These accolades, and others read elsewhere, were too freely bestowed on a very minor talent. Who are these book reviewers setting standards for the rest of us? Tracy Chevalier should give up writing -- no-one else can drag out nothingness for page after page as she can. I would not even pass this book along to friends.\"]",

Other than that, it works well.\", \"Nice Hot Dog Cooker for the Money I agree with some other reviews that say the switch feels flimsy and the lid hinges can get broken easily. I still like the product for the $NUM I paid for it. Didn't want one of those circus looking models which are smaller and more cheaply built.This unit will fit NUM bun length dogs. It will technically cook the dogs in TIME (after warm up) but I like mine more well done so I cook them for TIME depending on the diameter of the hot dog.Mine also came with the power light broken (this is why the NUM star rating instead of NUM) but I'll probably fix that myself after the warranty runs out. I think I can tell when the unit is on.I don't understand what others expect for $NUM. If you want a tank of a product then you should go spend NUM times more for a commercial unit.I like the product, its only NUM watts and I don't think you will find a better hot dog roller for the money.\", \"Worked well, but poor quality and not very durable I purchased the 'pillsplitter' in DATE and have used it NUM or NUM times to split approximately NUM pills. It worked fine and performed well, while it lasted.The plastic hinge has cracked and it's no longer usable. Since the item was 'gently' used, I believe it's a design flaw.

It just decided to wink off with no warning. Internet research into the problem indicated that this has happened to many, many, many people. Called Cuisinart, thinking I had a DATE warranty, but my serial number indicated it was refurbished - news to me. Anyway, I'm out of luck. Next time, I'm getting a cheap $NUM-NUM model (and not a Cuisinart) - short sighted business people that they are.\", 'Broke in DATE When it worked, it worked great.

Not happy with this purchase!', 'Good product but poor delivery I love my new kitchen aid mixer. I made DATE cookies DATE. However, I will say it did almost overheat once. My only complaint was the way it was shipped. It was shipped in its packaging. They didnt cover it in anything. Therefore, everyone could see what was waiting on the porch for me. I am very glad it didnt get taken. They really should have put it in another box. Plus, It was snowing and the porch was wet. Hopefully, this was just an oversight by some worker over DATE.

Luckily I had bought NUM books, and one of the others is outstanding.

The book itself is poorly organized. The first NUM pages are complete filler, so characteristic of poorly written workout literature. To clarify, this book is lined with encyclopedic coverage of many aspects of training such as diet, weight training... basically a topical review of stuff anyone but the complete novice would already know. The workouts outlined in the book are simply listed without pictures... what gives! Furthermore in the pictured section on core exercises, the authors simply cluster core exercises together into broad sections without explaining which muscles the exercises are targeting. Finally, the models in this book are all old and ugly. I wish I could return this book.

The questions are poorly worded, if your answer is wrong you are insulted and for a book based on the teaching of reading - it was full of typos.

The book left out important details that will be on the exam, had an above average number of errors, poor questions, and surprisingly, included a lot of needless information that won\\'t be on the exam. For example, the troubleshooting chapter had very general, obvious, tips rather than recommending a certain cable tester for a sample situation, which is what will be on the test, or what is the problem if a DVM gives a certain reading? Another example, the NUM Microsoft troubleshooting steps should be listed, rather than just mentioned in one paragraph.

Identifying pathologies is one thing, identifying your own unhealthy self-perceptions is the treasure and this book enables you to do that (if you're willing to take a look within).I love how Sandra gives the power back to the reader by always getting them to contemplate with integrity - for them to admit that they WILLINGLY got into these relationships in the first place, so it's not about blaming men per se.

You won't find any definitive and final answers on the big questions (the Bible won't give you those either) but you will find someone who engages the topic of hell in a humble and honest spirit.

The book is set up in such a way that one can instantly access any aspect of persuasion. There are many different topics that the author elaborates on. He explains different methods and then proceeds to elaborate on them. The book is packed with helpful tips. Each chapter includes true stories and potential situations. In addition to the book being extremely helpful, the book was hilarious. The author slips in humor and wit with ease. The book was a very enjoyable read rather than what could have been very boringly elaborated on.The section about employees at booths was especially helpful to me.

This certainly can help evangelical Christians to know how to more sensitively and lovingly portray the Gospel to a post-modern western audience.In the end however, it just made me want to read \"Permission Marketing\", the book he copied and put a Christian message into.

Granted - I\\'ve never heard of this game show (don\\'t watch TV), but I was expecting a bit of gaming to be involved with this game. The repetitive commentary between picking the cases gets annoying. I played it once and, other than letting other members of my family play it for the first time, it probably will remain untouched from then on. Very disappointing that for all the conceptualizing, marketing, research and programing that goes into creating a game from scratch that they wouldn\\'t have put a bit more \"umph\" into the actual game inself.

I spent some time looking for fun NUM player games, and based on all the great reviews for Street Fighter Alpha NUM, I decided to rent it. Man, was I disappointed. I thought this game wasn't just bad, it was terrible. I guess you have to be a fan of the Street Fighter genre to enjoy this... I never played any of the other Street Fighter games so I did not know what to expect. If you like Street Fighter games, then I guess all these other positive reviews are the ones to go by. If not, then I say skip this game. I would suggest renting it before owning it, but even that would be a waste of too much money. The graphics looked like something you would have seen on the old Nintendo system. Not only was there very little detail, but the movement is incredibly choppy. Stick to Twisted Metal NUM and Tekken NUM if you want a fun NUM player fighting game with good graphics and great gameplay.\", \"pretty good game I borrowed Buck Bumble from a friend awhile back and I thought it was a pretty good game. The only things I didn't like about it were that after you get past mission NUM, it gets too hard and every time you get killed, you have to start all the way over in that level. It's fun flying and killing the enemies and the boss levels are a lot of fun, but Buck has to be the slowest walker ever made when you try combat from the ground. The insects and graphics are done pretty well, but they could be a little bit better. The sound is probably the best attribute to the game other than the fun factor.To keep it from getting too boring, there's a NUM player soccer game that makes this game a lot better. If you want a challenging shooting/adventure game, this could be a good game to get.\", \"Warning Warning:some people complain you don't playh much at the beginning, well thats somewhat true, but if you do not watch what happens, then the game will be so much worse.

So, i rented it. I am sorry to say it's just as bad, and actually worse. I couldn't even get through TIME of it. The graphics are poor even for a ps2, the sound is awful, the commentary ... and the controls are atrocious. The ski jumping is awful and the bobsled is just as bad. You get never sensation of speed or any sensation at all, really. The gameplay feels really dead. There's no life to any of it.

How can games like this be called \"games\" when all you do is sit there watching tv while the controller lay helplessly in your hands? I rented this game (thank God) before I was going to buy it.

         "[\"Best Dance DVD - You will lose weight I was looking for something to spark my routine. I found a clip on youtube and liked what I saw. Checked out the price on Amazon and took a chance..the best [...] bucks I ever spent. You will sweat you butt off, I couldn't do all the routines but by my 4th workout I was improving. In DATE; NUM sessions I lost NUM IBS. I could not believe it. No DVD workout has did that before and trust me I have all of them. You actually have fun with this DVD, by the time you realize it you have done TIME. There isn't alot of teaching here so just follow along. I reminded me of the latin parties growing up in NYC. I loved the music and the lil gal is so energetic, she makes you want to go the extra mile. Try it, it is a nice break from circuit training.Loved it.\", 'NOT a good workout! I am a belly dancer and I thought I might like this DVD because Hula is SO similar! I was looking forward to it but was very disappointed.DETAILS:I DID NOT like this \"workout\" at all. The first NUM minutes are fine - not bad at all. After that it becomes mundane and VERY BORING. It is VERY slow moving and yet . . . there is NOT ENOUGH CUEING.Since this is targeted to beginners the instructor should have BROKEN DOWN THE MOVES to make them understandable and more doable. She DOES NOT do this.MY SYNOPSIS:Beginners WILL get LOST and the more advanced will be BORED.This DVD did not hold my attention and was NOT it a good work out. I\\'m sorry. I have to say thumbs down! God bless.', \"Aerobics section is great The aerobics section of this video is beginner/intermediate level and great! It's fun and Karen is an excellent instructor. I also like that it's short. If you are an advanced exerciser, use this on your easy DATE or try something more difficult. Perfect for the average exerciser. Unique set makes it more interesting to look at than some other videos. I've had the video forever and still enjoy getting it out, although the bar section (I even bought the bar) never thrilled me.\", 'not a workout!!! I didnt have high expextations when I ordered this tape - I know from ecperience that NUM-NUM-NUM minute classes on the same tape might mean you have to run the tape in the middle of the exsersize or too match cool down/worm up or not enough. But having many of Janes workouts that work for me so well I desided to go for it, because I need more tapes for the time I am in harry fro work and I only have TIME.I was so dissappointed! this is not a workout at all - just a seies of dances (very good I admit and fun to do) - no worm up, no cool down, there is a note of TIME end but no streches or anything, there is no note that TIME ended - finally after TIME I had to go so I did my own quick cool down and stopped the tape ..Buy this tape ony if you need aerobic part for another workout and you dont mind switching the tapes all the time.', 'disappointing for intermediate-level yoga fan I thought that this would be a fast-paced and strenuous workout, but it is far too slow. Also, the instructor never stopped talking, which I found extremely distracting and annoying. I think this would be a better workout for novices, who need instruction on form and more time to get into the feel of a pose. I will try to find someone to give this DVD to; all I can say is that at least I only blew [a little cash] on this one.I far prefer my Power Yoga: The Complete Workout with Rodney Yee (flowing poses with minimal yakking)--although it is definitely for someone who is already familiar with basic yoga poses.', \"I don't get it Based on these glowing reviews, I was expecting a fantastic program. My first minor complaint is the voiceover narration. I can understand why yoga instructors choose this format, but I guess I'm partial to live instruction. Perhaps I would have found the voiceover narration more tolerable had this dvd been setup differently. A mix-n-match option sounds like a potentially great idea, but the routines on this dvd are choppy and repetitive. My biggest complaint is the constant use of props. I bought this dvd to relax and relieve stress. I did not buy this dvd to fold towels in thirds.. place pillows here and there.. etc...This is a hugely overrated title, in my opinion.\", \"Couldn't even watch it! I can't really comment on the dvd's content--I only watched TIME. So let me tell you why I threw the dvd in the trash after barely even watching it. The lady's thick New York accent was a really annoying turn off. Plus she is old(and I don't mean to be rude by saying that). I prefer to work out with an instructor my age with a charasmatic personality and a body that I wish I had. I sooo did not get my needs met with this lame dvd. Unless you're old and/or deaf, don't waste your money! Try Crunch Total Resculpt or any of the Karen Voight dvds instead.\", 'Excellent conditioning This is a great workout DVD for strength and dance conditioning; it is quite a challenge the first few times,and left me sore for DATE - which, in a workout, is a desirable outcome. I highly recommend it.', \"Amazing I've done a lot of workout DVDs and Jillian Michaels' are by far my favorites. I don't need to lose a lot, maybe another NUM-NUM lbs, but really wanted to tone up. I started with her DATE Shred and just received her No More Trouble Zones, which I did for the first time DATE. OMG! I have NEVER felt the effects of a workout like this, and I LOVE it. My obliques are even sore, which is so reassuring that I've actually worked them! I was dripping sweat by the end. I can't wait to do it again!! And I am excited to see how I'll look and feel in DATE. HELLO SUMMER!\", \"don't waste your time and money The book is so confusing and complicated. It will take me hours, maybe days, to read all the instructions for each move and learn the sequence. I have read many exercise books and this one is so awful. You really need the DVD for the Total Workout. The DVD costs $NUM on her website. So ridiculously expensive! Plus, I don't understand how her exercises could be aerobic by doing some knee/leg lifts at a moderate pace and strength training (bone-building) without lifting any weights. Please don't waste your time and money on this book.\"]",

         "[\"The worst pictures I have ever seen DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. . . at least, don't buy this camera if you want to actually have decent pictures to print and keep for a lifetime and for generations to come. I actually read the manual and learned how to use all the features and still NUM% of the pictures I've taken over DATE are blurred or very pixillated. Yes, I modified the pixels to the highest resolution and am still having issues. If you want a cheap camera, and don't care about having quality pictures to preserve, then this is the camera for you. If not, save the $NUM+ dollars you would have spent, and budget for a more expensive, higher quality camera. I'm sending mine back and upgrading. One positive note is the Camedia software. I've used it with a higher quality Olympus camera (a lot more $) which was stolen from me DATE, and I really love it; which is why I'm staying with the Olympus brand, despite the poor quality of the D-Series model.\", \"Excellent I had had this camera for DATE now and I can't tell you had much I love it. It has many more fetures than I would ever use but there are some drawbacks to this item. First, in low light conditions you must hold this camera steady after pushing the button or your pics come out blurred. Other than that it is a well made product.\", 'Gawd Has Foresaken me... I got this camera very quickly, service was fantastic. I say this because any retailer who sells these shouldnt feel too responsible for the sin that is this camera. I have had my dealings with NUM.2mp cameras, some made in DATE and I am very appalled to have used this camera and to get this kind of low quality shot.Pictures are blurry. Well unless you use the flash, then they are completely \"pixelated\" and are engulfed in white.This is not a deal for the money, it doesnt even serve its purpose as a camera.I will say I love the design of the camera, and this just makes me want apple to delve into the camera industry.Conclusion: dont purchase this if you\\'re looking for something to take pictures with. If you want to load this on your computer and waste your time, go for it, otherwise, buy anything else.', \"User friendly and great results I have been interested in photography for DATE, but this is the first good quality camera I have ever owned. I found this camera very easy to use right out of the box. After TIME I got up the courage to take the camera of auto and see what else it could do. I found the menus easy to navigate and was able to produce great results with DATE of practice. The macro setting is amazing and the anti shake feature lives up to its promise. I haven't even needed to use a tripod. I am extremely happy with my purchase and look forward to getting many DATE of use out of this camera.\", \"DATE On and Still Going Strong Hard to believe it's been DATE, but my Powershot A510 has served me incredibly well. It has shot about NUM,NUM photos, TIME of video. It has been dropped twice by accident, from about NUM feet on to concrete both times, been exposed to subfreezing weather, NUM degree weather, flown in an open cockpit biplane, dented and finish worn, but it still takes very good photographs.One of the first smaller cams with 4x zoom, and the Digic I processor ensures very good pictures. Full manual control is also nice. How good is the picture quality? I found that when mounted on a tripod, the A510 would take sharper pictures than a EOS Digital Rebel using a $NUM wide-angle lens. Compacts have matched lens/sensor pairs and this is a good example.The only negative features- Limited 640x480 video time to TIME, pretty chunky overall.This little Canon has outlasted two other point and shoots, a Kodak V705, and a Coolpix S570.Recommended, even at DATE.\", 'Does everything I need and more! Good:much smaller than I expected. It slides easily into a coat pocket.great image quality. Even a novice/lazy photographer like me can get amazing pictures!easy to use (see above)Bad:battery dies when connected to the computer. Buy a spare.software program not intuitive. Also--\"Olympus Master\"? Creepy. I edit in the camera or using MS Photo Editor or Photoshop.no viewfinder means sometimes you\\'re not sure what you\\'re shooting. It\\'s more than a mild annoyance, but in balance it\\'s okay because you\\'re getting a great camera at a reduced price.', \"Not good! I don't think that this camra is very good, I took pictures and the dpi is really bad it's too big and the pictures look really bad also. I was amazed how fast the Batteries ran out. I suggest you don't buy this.\", \"The Best of the Best I've had NUM cameras in DATE and this, by far, is the best. It's easy to use, takes good pictures, and yet, if you want to get more complicated, you can do your own settings. And, the optical lens is wonderful. This is a keeper.\", \"This piece of junk died on me Usually, I have good experiences with Toshiba's products. For example, I have a Toshiba DVD player that I am very happy with. However, this digital camera was a disappointment in almost every aspect. A minor gripe was the short battery life, but that's a very common problem with digital cameras in general. Major problem #NUM: This camera has a VERY hard time focusing in low-light situations. Unless you're in a brightly lit room or outside on DATE, your pictures stand a good chance of being out of focus. Major problem #NUM: I owned this camera DATE when it refused to recognize the existence of batteries. I tried many different types of fresh batteries, but it says they're all dead. Now I have to look into getting warranty service. If I had it to do over, I would have invested a little more in a higher-quality camera (and a brand other than Toshiba). You really do get what you pay for when it comes to digital cameras.\", 'disappointing After DATE of light use, the camera stopped working. Also, the output format was very difficult to work with.
